        "description": "Explain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the environment. What can governments do to address these problems? What can individuals do to help?",
        "paragraphs": [
            "It is known that humans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can also take steps to minimize the damages that we are causing to the planet. This essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems.",
            "Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. As the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.",
            "Governments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. They could also impose \u2018green taxes\u2019 on drivers and airline companies. In this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions. Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. They can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as \u2018banks\u2019 for recycling glass, plastic and paper in their car parks. By reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste. In conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment."

        "description": "Some people believe that it is wrong to keep animals in zoos, while others think that zoos are both entertaining and ecologically important. Discuss both views.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "In this modern world, perspectives of how to keep animals are varied among people. Some people think about caging them in zoos or forests while others think it is illogical to limit animals\u2019 movements. I am going to discuss these views according to environmental, personal and economic perspectives.",
            "Keeping some animals in zoos will protect them against predators, bad weather, and food inavailability. Nevertheless, keeping animals free is more logical than isolating them because if we keep animals caged, they would not be able to have fresh air and chase other animals. Therefore, it is cruel keeping animals confined in small spaces. It is advisable to put our efforts into keeping our creatures in their natural habitats, in order to give them the opportunity to experience normal life.",
            "Keeping animals is essential because some animals are in fact becoming extinct. Although keeping these animals is costly, the profits made by keeping these animals are substantial. Take Indian lions for example; a wide range of people travel to India to see these animals in circuses in India. However, some people think that governments should invest the money in improving the infrastructure of their nations instead. Building new electrical power station, for instance, is more important than spending thousands of pounds to preserve certain creatures from extinction. Lastly, keeping animals is important for study and research whereas others think we have no right to use animals for entertainment and in labs.",
            "To conclude, keeping animals in zoos might have values but it is irrational to keep these animals away from their natural habitat. The reasons are that besides they are not vulnerable creatures, they have the right to survive independently because of having feelings and emotions as human."

        "paragraphs": [
            "It is believed that men and women should have the same educational opportunities. However, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject. This essay will explain the reasons why admitting equal numbers of male and female students in every major is impractical.",
            "First, having the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. Student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. If a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each gender. In reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. For example, nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty percent of the places needed to go to males.",
            "Apart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. In this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it would be wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.",
            "In conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender."

            "On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.",
            "At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.",
            "In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need."

            "There are things that can make a person happy, while others do not such as a stable job, a beautiful house, or winning a lottery. A person will be happy with his life if he is able to feed his family by having a permanent job. Also, if the house is decent, he will be happy to see how comfortable life is to live in a place with wonderful furniture and appliances. Finally, winning a huge sum of money is a dream coming true for most people. However, others do not like to buy lottery tickets because some people believe that once they have won the lottery, they might put their family's life at risk, perhaps, they think somebody will try to kidnap their kids and ask for a ransom.",
            "On the other hand, there are simple factors in attaining happiness. For example, when a family of five could meet the basic needs such as food, clothing and a house, these could make a family satisfied with what they already have in life as long as they are together. Another example is being able to pass an English proficiency test to be qualified to become a registered nurse in Canada. Most foreign workers would be very glad if they could pursue their career after passing such a test.",

Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits. What is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?",

            "Education is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. I believe that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who choose to pursue a university degree. In a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. This kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.",
            "I would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people\u2019s freedom to succeed or fail. In other words, equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. On the contrary, I believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. Those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity.",
            "Inequality, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds.",

            "On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museums is designed to be visually spectacular, and it may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.",
            "On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum\u2019s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. This way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects of life.",

            "When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.",
            "The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.",
            "On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.",

Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.",
            "There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers and marketing. This money might be better spent on other public services. Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group. Despite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. A language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. If a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. By spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs and behaviours that are part of a country\u2019s history.",
            "In conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage."

It is unadvisable to proceed with any job, if the employer is not taking into account the vital paths required in convincing their employees to continue their jobs properly. In this essay, I am going to address the contributing factors to job satisfaction which are in terms of working hours, salaries and graduates.",
            "It has been essential to understand individuals\u2019 commitments to exclude this particular fellow from 9 to 5 working hours. For example, some people cannot be punctual at work because they have disabled daughters or sons, who could not be able to travel to school independently. Therefore, it is important to change the original time schedule to give these people flexibility. So this type of help would give them more job contentment.",
            "The fact that could not be denied and encourage the employee remarkably is the reliable salaries in addition to promotions to the highly achievable workers. For example, if a worker in a factory is able to fix a broken down one of the machines, it is illogical not to reward this worker for his great help to the factory. Therefore, if we award this worker, he will be grateful and more confident to his job. Awarding and reasonable salaries are essential elements to job satisfaction.",

            "One obvious way of doing this is to offer extra money to employees who are seen to be working exceptionally hard and this is done in companies with a product to sell. For example, real estate agents or department stores can offer a simple commission on all sales.",
            "This style of management favors people who can demonstrate their contribution through sales figures, but does not take into account the work done by people behind the scenes who little contact with the public. A better approach is for management to offer a bonus to all the staff at the end of year if the profits are healthy. This, however, does not allow management to target individuals who have genuinely worked harder than others.",

In fact, new hobbies come and go. For example, sports such as rollerblading lose their fascination after a few months. Similarly, although snowboarding has taken over from traditional skiing, it is doubtful whether its popularity will last. Other things like electronic games go out of date almost as soon as you have bought them because the manufacturers promote the fact that only the latest version is worth having. And so ensure continued sales.",

Traditional hobbies range from participation in active sports like tennis to old favorites such as chess and stamp collecting, and these continue to be popular. By joining a club, people can make friends and feel part of a group with whom they can share a common interest and leisure time. Where sport is concerned, most people know what they like and participate out of love of the game, rather than because it is currently fashionable.",

            "In the past, most developing countries were short of ready funds to build the infrastructure necessary for development. Therefore, foreign countries were asked to provide loans for projects to help the countries become self-reliant. However, this money was often used to make quick profits for developers or to line the pockets of corrupt officials. Once the money is used, the problem of repayment begins.",
            "Since the 1970s many developing countries have found that they cannot pay back the loans or even the interest is accumulated on the loans. Consequently, the countries have borrowed more money to pay back the interest. This gave Western countries the power to dictate government policy through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These financial institutions are only interested in balance sheets. Therefore, nations have been forced to adopt policies which do nothing to develop their resources or improve the lives of the local people. Countries that get caught in this debt spiral have no chance of paying back the initial money borrowed, while the banks making the loans make two or three times the money lent after the interest payments are taken into account. As most donor countries have already been repaid, both in terms of money and in term of economic interest, it is morally right for developing countries to refuse to pay back foreign loans.",

Furthermore, these problems are urgent as nobody knows when our natural world will be so damaged that it will no longer be able to support us.

This can impact food production and can have severe affects for people in both urban and rural areas.",
            "Finally, as a country\u2019s economy develops, there may be an increasing sense of inequality as the towns get richer and the villages get poorer, and this may lead to more crime and even civil unrest. The key to reducing these problems seems to lie in improving the standard of living and the facilities available in the countryside. Perhaps incentives can be offered to factories and companies to relocate; road and rail networks can be built to make such relocation possible; doctors and teachers could be required to spend part of their professional lives in rural areas.",
            "In conclusion, discrepancies in economic growth can cause pressures on the overall living standards and many production activities. The essential way to deal with this is to try to rebalance the equality scale between urban and rural areas, by improving facilities and relocating businesses to the less advantaged regions."

            "However, there are different kinds of music and the qualities of classical music traditions are not necessarily part of the music many people experience today. In the modern world, there is a huge music industry that sells piped music to supermarkets and advertisers. We are also constantly exposed to loud modern music from people\u2019s CD players, iPods or car radios. So the view of music today as a kind of noise pollution produced by money-driven people, is also a common and negative one, but it is difficult to think of a world without music.",

But people\u2019s taste in music tends to change as they get older, and it would be difficult to find someone who had no positive musical associations at all.

This is mainly due to the larger social and technological changes that have increased the gap between the generations. Young people today are generally better educated, and because they have been trained from a young age to use computer technology, they have Internet access to information in a way that was unimaginable for earlier generations. This means that they are probably better informed than their parents\u2019 grandparents were at their age, and their hi-tech skills give them confidence in dealing with the very rapid changes in technology that are so uncomfortable for older people.",
            "In addition, younger people are often the most affected by globalization. They follow fashions in clothes, music and social habits that are common among young people throughout the world. So they have become powerful consumers who influence big global markets today. As a result of these developments, relationships with older people are often difficult. Teachers and parents are treated with less respect, and experience is undervalued because young people think they know everything, or at least can learn about everything from the Internet. In many cultures, this has led to a decline in school discipline, an increase in family breakdowns and even serious social problems.",

            "In every country, there are fashions among students about which subjects are the best to the study at university. Sometimes the popularity of a subject is determined by how much money a graduate could subsequently earn in that field. Or subjects that are perceived as relatively \u2018easy\u2019 may also become popular, in spite of later difficulties of finding appropriate employment. It is up to governments to give incentives to students to choose subjects that match the needs of their society.",
            "Obviously one way to do this would be for the government to pay the fees of those choosing such subjects. The advantage would certainly be that higher number of students would enroll and would later fill the employment gaps.",
            "However, the disadvantages of such a policy would be considerable. For example, the students attracted by the funding may not have any real interest in or aptitude for that subject. Such students may drop out before graduation or after working only a short time in a related job. Furthermore, funding one group of students but not other would penalize those with a genuine interest and ability for another field. Such discrimination would certainly affect the whole of higher education of the country, and students would develop very negative attitudes towards going to university altogether. This would be very counter-productive for any country. In conclusion, I think there are many other incentives for students that could be considered, such as making courses more interesting to take, or the job rewards greater after graduation. The education policy proposed above, however, would certainly have more long-term disadvantages than benefits for society."

            "It is certainly true that today traffic in cities throughout the world has become a major problem. This is obvious from the number of vehicles on our roads and the amount of pollution they cause. Probably the traffic problem is due to people commuting for work, study and other purposes and this is evident in the rush hours.",
            "It is also true that today such daily commuting is not always necessary because people can do these things from home, we can see this in the options Information Technology gives us today. For instance, on-line work, distance learning and shopping facilities are all available via the internet.",
            "However, even if everyone had access to the technology and the opportunity to work from home, it is unrealistic to think that everyone would want to. Even though the technology for working, studying or shopping on-line makes this option a possibility, it would mean people had less freedom of choice and less social contact in their lives. This would have a large impact on society as a whole. So, in conclusion, I think that while this practice could reduce the traffic problems in our cities, it is most unlikely to be an acceptable solution. In terms of other solutions, perhaps we need to think more carefully about facilitating public transport and limiting private cars in our city centers. The development of public transport that is not road-based, such as sky trains or subways would probably be a more workable alternative measure to reduce congestion on our roads."

Finally, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and can they interact through their computers rather than face to face.",
            "On the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. Nowadays, interactions via email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. For example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than bonding with their peers in the real world, and these \u2018virtual\u2019 relationships are a poor a substitute for real friendships.",

Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable. On the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. In my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. Despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.",
            "On the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. If an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. For example, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. In my case, it took me around two years before I became competent at this activity, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started. I believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.",

When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.",
            "At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.",

International pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people.

Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users\u2019 motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.",
            "However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console.

The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an aging population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.",
            "There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.",

To use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.",

Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, and I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.

While some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, I believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources. Some art projects definitely require help from the state. In the UK, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. In Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. These artworks represent culture, heritage and history. They serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. Governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.",
            "On the other hand, I can understand the arguments against government funding for art. The main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. For example, state budgets need to be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. These public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. Another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.",

Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation and travel. The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.",
            "If travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. To take the UK as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul\u2019s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation\u2019s cultural heritage. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.",

Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.",
            "However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.",

If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family. Nevertheless, I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships work environment are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers\u2019 levels of happiness and general quality of life.

On the one hand, many people do achieve fame without really working for it. They may have inherited money from parents, married a famous or wealthy person, or they may have appeared in gossip magazines or on a reality TV programme. A good example would be Paris Hilton, who is rich and famous for the wrong reasons.

Secondly, we all pay a certain amount of tax for public services that we may not use. For example, most people are fortunate enough not to have to call the police or fire brigade at any time in their lives, but they would not expect a tax reduction for this. Finally, if wealthy families were given a tax discount for sending their children to private schools, we might have a situation where poorer people pay higher taxes than the rich.",

It is beneficial for all members of society to have a high quality education system with equal opportunities for all young people. This will result in a well-educated workforce, and in turn a more productive and prosperous nation. Parents of children in private schools may also see the advantages of this in their own lives. For example, a company owner will need well qualified and competent staff, and a well-funded education system can provide such employees. In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should be made for people who choose private education."

            "Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. I completely disagree with this point of view.",
            "In my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21st century. I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world\u2019s population. There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.",
            "I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. For example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the Earth\u2019s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on Earth.",

Equal rights movements have made great progress, and it has become normal for women to gain qualifications and pursue a career. It has also become socially acceptable for men to stay at home and look after their children. At the same time, the rising cost of living has meant that both marriage partners usually need to work and save money before starting a family. Therefore, when couples have children, they may decide who works and who stays at home depending on the personal preference of each partner, or based on which partner earns more money.",
            "In my view, the changes described above should be seen as progress. We should be happy to live in a society in which men and women have equal opportunities, and in which women are not put under pressure to sacrifice their careers. Equally, it seems only fair that men should be free to leave their jobs in order to assume childcare responsibilities if this is what they wish to do. Couples should be left to make their own decisions about which parental role each partner takes, according to their particular circumstances and needs.",

            "On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.",
            "On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that do not punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "Should governments give more financial support to local film industries? It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidising the industry. There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like \u2018Avatar\u2019 or the James Bond films are examples of such productions, and their global appeal is undeniable. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.",
            "In my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.",

            "On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today\u2019s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the \u2018rules\u2019 around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.",
            "On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one\u2019s best, and taking pride in one\u2019s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today\u2019s competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 sense of community and neighbourliness.",

            "There are clear arguments for banning smoking, based largely on health, but there is perhaps a stronger case to be made for maintaining the current situation, as will now be explained.",
            "The most important factor for keeping smoking legal is that the decision to smoke is not something that should be controlled by the government, but by the individuals. If a person decides to smoke, they do so of their own free will and this should be respected, as it is the government's role to advise against harmful practices, but ultimately not to make decisions for its citizens.",
            "The other reason for allowing smoking is that by making laws against it is more likely to result in the sale of tobacco moving to the black market, and consequently increasing the level of associated crime. There will still be people who cannot overcome their addiction, and will search for any means available to access cigarettes. A clear example of this reaction can be seen in the illegal sale of other drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. Obviously, there is the fact that smoking is known to have adverse health effects on both the smoker and those around them who are affecting by passive smoking. Yet there are other lifestyle choices that also have a negative impact, such as fast food and alcohol, and banning these items would restrict the choice available to the consumers.",

Yet there are now online videos and websites where these animals can be seen in high definition, therefore no longer needing to go to enclosures to see the animals. This is clearly evident by the declining number of visitors in recent years.",
            "In addition, there are many cases in which animals held in captivity are not well cared for and are used solely to exploit them for profit. In some rare cases, the animals can suffer from neglect or malnutrition, and rather than being kept healthy are simply replaced when they are no longer of any value. Granted, there are situations in which endangered species are protected and their numbers allowed to rebuild by housing them in the security of a zoo. However, in most cases the same effect is better achieved by using more open plan wildlife parks rather than traditional caged enclosures.",

Lethargy or lack of knowledge leads people to throw all of their rubbish into one place, meaning that material that could have been sorted and reused is buried in landfills. In the UK, for example, over 20 million tonnes of waste is buried whilst less than 1 percent of that amount is actively recycled. There is also the matter of availability, as there are situations in which recycling facilities are either extremely limited or nonexistent.",
            "In order to combat these issues, the first step would be educating the general public about the facts of waste disposal and recycling, perhaps even enforcing participation by levying a fine against those who do not separate their rubbish into different types.

            "The main advantage of requiring people to leave their job at a certain age is that it provides opportunities for younger members of staff to join the workforce, often meaning that companies benefit from having lower wages to pay for the new recruits and also having younger, potentially more dynamic employees. This in turn could well give the company the required boost to continue being profitable.",
            "Another advantage is that some older people may choose to keep working more out of habit than enjoyment, and therefore a mandatory retirement may encourage them to enjoy their life more, having the free time to engage in hobbies and interests such as gardening, which they may not have previously had time for up to that point.",
            "Yet there are significant disadvantages in forced retirement. Older staff members often have more experience, and may have no desire to leave their job. Requiring them to leave could mean a skill shortage for the company as well as a feeling of discontent from the employee. Added to that is the rising number of older people and the subsequent drain on resources if they are not working; if there are more elderly people on pensions or other benefits, the increased tax burden falls on the younger generation.",

            "In many countries, pupils are required to wear uniforms when attending school, and I believe this is something that should be enforced for the following reasons. Primarily, students, especially those in their teenagers years, are under pressure both academically and socially; insisting on a standardised uniform within the school alleviates some of this as it means that the student does not have to worry about whether their peers think that they are dressed well or in the latest fashions. This has the added advantage for those from lower income families who may simply not be able to afford the clothes worn by those from more affluent families. Not only does it remove the social pressure, but wearing a school uniform also has a psychological advantage, as the student is dressed in the mode of attire used for study. Much like wearing a suit and tie may signal going to work for many people, wearing a school uniform prepares the child for the day of learning. However, this perhaps works best for younger students. By age 16 or 17, it may be appropriate for the student to wear more casual clothing when they reach their later teens, as the idea of 'conforming' by wearing a uniform could discourage the student from pursuing further education and this is often the time in which young adults are looking to establish their own clear identity. It is at this point that it may be more productive to allow more relaxed clothing such as jeans.",

My sentiment is on par with this viewpoint, and some of my good grounds will be presented in the essay below.",
            "It is conspicuous that academic qualifications are of great significance when comes to seeking employment. Undoubtedly, academic qualifications reflect a person\u2019s educational background and personal experiences. This usually lays a foundation for an overall evaluation of any candidate. Based on what is written and listed in those certificates and degrees, recruiters would select the most appropriate one to join their organizations. In other words, educational achievements can exert a tremendous impact on the judgment of the employers who are looking for potential white-collar workers.",
            "Simultaneously, it cannot be denied that the art of social interaction plays a pivotal role in one\u2019s success as well. In actual fact, in this day and age, having a high level of social skills is considered to be a strength in the workplace. This is due to the fact that managers often put an emphasis on the ability of coordination, cooperation, and communication to enhance efficiency. A salient example of this is the solidarity of the staff within an office, which would foster a positive attitude towards work and a sense of community, leading to a sense of self-satisfaction from their job.",

The main reason in support of retaining parkland is that it provides a communal area for people who may otherwise live in apartments or small houses without access to a garden. It has been well documented that time spent outdoors has clear health benefits, not only for exercise and fresh air, but also for mental health. Another reason is that increasing populations in urban areas has a number of negative subsidiary effects, such as the pressure on sanitation and clean water supplies. Replacing parks with more housing will only further compound this problem. In Mexico City, for example, the population is so dense that in many areas, delivery of fresh water supplies is under extreme pressure. On a related note, there is also an environmental advantage in having parkland, as it is a source of oxygen production which may otherwise be lacking in urban areas.",
            "Admittedly, the level of the population relocating to urban areas in increasing for employment reasons as there are often more jobs available, and for this to be possible, additional land will need to be used for housing and this needs to be sourced near the place of work to avoid excess travel.

Modernised production methods allow goods to be mass produced at a lower cost, but often at the expense of quality; this means that although they may not have the durability of handmade items, they are cheaper and thus can be replaced. In addition, evolutions in technology are now rapid, and the impulse to own the latest gadget encourages purchasers to continually buy new items. A clear indication of this is mobile phones, where in the last decade new features and abilities are released constantly.",
            "To address this, there are a number of potential approaches. One is that governments could raise the level of tax on brand new items whilst lowering the taxation on repair shops, therefore supporting those who are happy with their existing technology and penalising those who constantly race to acquire the very latest model. In turn, this would encourage the companies producing such items to build them in a way that new developments can be incorporated into it, rather than requiring it to be disposed of.",

Perhaps the most persuasive reason is that children have a far better ability to learn when young compared to later on in life. Information is more readily absorbed and put into practice, and younger children are able to retain what they are taught. It has also been proven that when learning a language at a young age, a child is able to better pronounce words or sounds that may be absent in their own language. In addition, younger children also have fewer external concerns to contend with. To illustrate, a parent with a job, bills and the responsibilities of looking after their children will be less able to focus on learning a new language compared to a child who is simply attending school. The younger the better, as this also means that they are not yet overwhelmed with homework and other preoccupations common to students in their early and mid teens.",

If the parent feels they are not suited to the task, or the law in that country does not allow parents to teach their children to drive, then a driving instructor should be sought, not a school. In addition, it could be argued that although operating a car is a useful skill, it is not essential and should be something that each individual decides rather than being a compulsory part of their education. Other subjects which provide a more rounded education should be emphasised, as this will allow the student to be able to find a position of employment more easily once they graduate from school or further studies. However, an argument could be made that the ability to drive could be required in an emergency situation, and therefore should be taught. Yet situations where this would actually be required would be rare, and less valuable than other skills such as first aid.",

            "Considering both points of view, it seems that a compromise may be the best solution. Payment of the unemployment benefit should be limited to a short period of time, after which the amount received should be progressively reduced. This would encourage those receiving the benefit to be more proactive when looking for work."

            "The primary reason to disagree with the statement is that a considerable amount of time that youngsters are on the internet is actually spent on social networking sites such as Facebook. As these sites are specifically designed for social purposes, the argument that social skills are declining would appear to be invalid. It is only when the time online is spent playing single player games or generally surfing for entertainment without interacting with others online that this could be considered unsociable.",
            "In addition, an increasing dependence on the Internet for a broad range of tasks from completing homework and studies to checking bank balances and searching for employment means that being online is often simply an alternative manner of working or completing necessary chores, and should not be considered related to social skills at all. Admittedly, if too much time is spent online playing games or looking at websites, then there is the potential for surfers to become less able to interact with people directly. However, this can be negated by ensuring that time online is limited to a reasonable amount, and can even be controlled by using technology that actively records the amount of time online.",

            "A significant point in favour of this is that it provides a good support network for parents, both of whom may work outside of the home. Having grandparents on hand to look after the children can potentially provide a more stable environment as the child will have a familiar face at home until the parents have finished working. The influence of the grandparents extends beyond simple babysitting, however. They are able to provide a source of advice and knowledge that can greatly benefit all members of the family on a range of subjects, especially for when there are new born babies in the home as this can be a stressful time for new parents.",
            "There are, of course, also disadvantages in having older people at home. There is the issue of space, as the family home may not be big enough to accommodate everyone comfortably. There is also the issue of deciding which members of the family should live together, as both the husband and wife may both have living parents.",
            "To conclude, there are clear positives and negatives to having older members of the family living in the same house. Although at times there may be typical frictions when people live together, this is arguably outweighed by the advantages of the support and knowledge older people are able to offer."

People are constantly bombarded with pictures of people looking glamorous, but these photos have often been digitally altered for the best effect. Many young people, however, suffer from low self- esteem and feel that through operations they could look like the celebrities they see.",
            "Another argument against cosmetic procedures is that this diverts resources from more necessary surgeries, which in turn causes longer delays for those in desperate need. Even though such procedures may be done privately, it still requires the attendance of medical staff that would perhaps otherwise be available to the public health system. This can be seen in the waiting lists in the UK, for example, where it can take several months or longer to have a hip replacement operation.",
            "However, there are situations when cosmetic surgery can vastly improve the patient's quality of life, such as those who have suffered significant burns or other disfigurements. There are many examples of people for whom surgical work has allowed them to rebuild their life in ways which would have been exceptionally difficult or impossible otherwise.",

It is not uncommon for both parents to work outside of the home, meaning that there is less opportunity for people to spend the hours required in shopping, preparing and cooking, so opting for a quick and easy meal is often preferred.",
            "Another significant cause for this decline is that the skills that in previous generations were handed down from parents to children are no longer considered as valuable, and as such, many younger people simply lack the required knowledge. Already many traditional skills such as bread making are no longer passed on, and this is illustrated in the rising consumption of convenience food among younger people.",
            "A third contributor to the fall in traditional food preparation is also related to the modern global nature of most societies. Historically, traditional meals were common because the required ingredients were all that was available locally. These days, however, most large cities have shops and restaurants with food from all over the globe. A clear example of this influence is in the United Kingdom, where the most popular takeaway food is Indian cuisine.",

            "Increasing urban populations have led to a corresponding increase in the number of vehicles on the road, resulting in rising congestion in city centres. There are a number of potential solutions to the problem, as will now be discussed. Perhaps the first step to take would be to improve the availability of public transport and install bus lanes throughout the city. Whilst this would, in the short term, increase the pressure on the roads, it is likely to result in more people using public transport and leaving their vehicles at home. One way of encouraging people to adopt buses and trains is to lower the price and expand the timetable. Following that, local councils or the government could make it more difficult for car drivers to use their car by either charging a levy or only allowing certain vehicles in city areas on certain days. A similar system has been running in London for some time, and has resulted in fewer vehicles on the roads. An alternative idea, one which is more extreme than levies and selective use, is to simply prevent private passenger vehicles from entering the city at all. By having only public transport options, there would be no problem with congestion and would allow for more pedestrian areas in the metropolitan areas.",
            "To sum up, there are a range of options available to reduce the number of cars in the centre of cities, but ultimately they all rely on an increased public transport system and encouraging drivers and their passengers to use it."

However, this argument is flawed for a number of reasons as will now be presented.",
            "Although certain fields of study lead more directly into a position of employment, university education is valuable not only for the education learned but also as an indication that the person has the ability to learn, and as such it is irrelevant whether it is a career based course of study or something more intangible, like the arts. It suggests to potential employers that person can learn new skills, and this is often as important as what is already known.",
            "Moreover, those that complete an arts related degree could potentially go on to be writers, poets or playwrights, for example, and thus contribute to society in a cultural form rather than financially or technologically. The opinion that the writer is of less worth than the scientist is very biased, especially when it comes to a contribution to society.",

            "It needs to be considered first of all what motivated the student to leave their studies before they have graduated. If the decision was made due to financial constraints, then clearly adding an additional fine is simply adding to the pressure. For example, there are many older people who decide to go back to university but may already have a mortgage and dependent children, and may consequently find that their income is insufficient to cover their needs.",
            "Moreover, rather than attempting to make the student pay, it might be better to consider whether the student was actually given sufficient support during their studies. There are situations where the student may feel that they are not following the course and are unable complete the required assignments, and therefore leave the course. Retention rates may be improved if there were personal tutors on hand to offer advice to those students who are losing confidence in their ability to remain on the course.",

Before the arrival of computers, students traditionally had files and folders with their course notes, and this took up a considerable amount of room and was difficult to keep track of; now, complete lecture notes and much more can be stored on a flash drive that can be easily put in a pocket or bag. In addition, lectures and learning material can be made available online, allowing for a multimedia educational environment. This is likely to engage a wider range of students as it has the ability to cater for a wider range of learning styles. For example, some students study best by repeatedly listening to a teacher, and this can now be achieved more conveniently by having videos available.",
            "On the downside, there are occasions where information stored digitally can be deleted, overwritten or corrupted, all situations that do not occur on traditional paper based work.

However, the concept of plagiarism has long been a problem, and there are computer programs available today that will pinpoint the source of non original work.",

            "To begin with, the fact that we cannot escape from advertising is a significant cause for complaint. Constant images and signs wherever we look can be very intrusive and irritating at times. Take for example advertising on the mobile phone. With the latest technology mobile companies are now able to send advertising messages via SMS to consumer\u2019s phones whenever they choose. Although we expect adverts in numerous situations, it now seems that there are very few places we can actually avoid them.",
            "A further aspect of advertising that I would consider unethical is the way that it encourages people to buy products they may not need or cannot afford. Children and young people in particular are influenced by adverts showing the latest toys, clothing or music and this can put enormous pressure on the parents to buy these products. In addition, the advertising of tobacco products and alcohol has long been a controversial issue, but cigarette adverts have only recently been banned in many countries. It is quite possible that alcohol adverts encourage excessive consumption and underage drinking, yet restrictions have not been placed on this type of advertising in the same way as smoking.",
            "It is certainly true to say that advertising is an everyday feature of our lives. Therefore, people are constantly being encouraged to buy products or services that might be too expensive, unnecessary or even unhealthy.

            "There are several reasons why the conventional medical community is often dismissive of alternatives. Firstly, there has been little scientific research into such medicine, so there is a scarcity of evidence to support the claims of their supporters. Furthermore, people often try such treatment because of recommendations from friends, and therefore come to the therapist with a very positive attitude, which may be part of the reason for the cure. Moreover, these therapies are usually only useful for long-term, chronic conditions. Acute medical problems, such as accidental injury, often require more conventional methods.",
            "On the other hand, there remain strong arguments for the use of alternatives. Despite the lack of scientific proof, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that these therapies work. In addition, far from being dangerous, they often have few or no side effects, so the worst outcome would be no change. One of the strongest arguments for the effectiveness of alternative therapies in the West is that, whilst conventional medicine is available without charge, many people are prepared to pay considerable sums for alternatives. If they were totally unhelpful, it would be surprising if this continues.",

The majority of people want to improve their future career prospects and attending university is one of the best ways to do this as it increases a persons marketable skills and attractiveness to potential employers. In addition, further education is very expensive for many people, so most would not consider it if it would not provide them with a more secure future and a higher standard of living. Thus job prospects are very important.",
            "However, there are other benefits for individuals and society. Firstly, the independence of living away from home is a benefit because it helps the students develop better social skills and improve as a person. A case in point is that many students will have to leave their families, live in halls of residence and meet new friends. As a result, their maturity and confidence will grow enabling them to live more fulfilling lives. Secondly, society will gain from the contribution that the graduates can make to the economy.

For example, someone who has committed a serious offence such as assault will need a long time in prison in order to be sure they can be re-educated not to re-offend. In addition to this, longer prison sentences will act as a deterrent for someone who is thinking of committing a crime.",
            "However, some people argue that leaving people in prison for a long time means that they will mix with other criminals and so their character will not improve. One alternative is community service. This gives an offender the opportunity to give something positive back to society, and so it may improve their character. Also, the government could focus its resources on the causes of crime, which would lead to less crime in the future.",
            "In my opinion, it is important to look at alternative methods. Many countries have lengthy prison sentences, but crime has continued to increase throughout the world, so it is clear that this is not completely effective. That said, long prison sentences should remain for those who commit serious crimes such as assault or murder, as justice for the victim and their family should take priority.",

Although I agree that it is important to spend money on public services, I do not think spending on the arts is a waste of money. There are several reasons for spending a significant amount of the government budget on public services. First and foremost, public services are the things such as hospitals, roads and schools, and these things determine the quality of life that most of us will have. For example, if the government does not spend enough money on hospitals, the health of our society may decline. Similarly, if not enough money is spent on schools, our children may not be properly educated. Also, it will be the poor in our society that will be affected more if we do not spend enough on these things because they are the ones more dependent on such services. However, this does not mean that the arts should be completely neglected. To begin, it is difficult for many arts institutions to generate much profit, so without some help from the government, many theaters and other such places may have to close. Moreover, the arts also have an important impact on our quality of life. Many people get great pleasure in going to see music and theatre performances so it is important that the government assists such institutions so that they can continue to provide entertainment to the public.",

However, these days, it is often the case that children are neglected. This may be because of the fact that many parents in cities now both have to work so are often not around to give their children support when needed. Another factor is the increasing levels of poverty around the world. We have seen with globalization the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and this inevitably means that those who are poorer will have to resort to illegal means to get what others have. Of course, this will include the children in the poorer families.",

Although, as discussed above, it can be outside factors that lead to crime, it is still important to have severe punishments to deter teenagers from crime.

Another benefit would be that much more use would be made of public transport if it was improved. It is often the case that public transport in cities is very poor. For example, we often see old buses and trains that people would rather not use. High taxes would generate enough money to make the necessary changes.",
            "Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to such a solution. First and foremost, this would be a heavy burden on the car drivers. At present, taxes are already high for a lot of people, and so further taxes would only mean less money at the end of the month for most people who may have no choice but to drive every day. In addition, this type of tax would likely be set at a fixed amount. This would mean that it would hit those with less money harder, whilst the rich could likely afford it.

Secondly, setting up community projects to help foster more community spirit and help keep young people off the street is a good idea. For example, youth clubs or evening classes for teenagers would keep them occupied. Finally, more effective policing of inner city areas would also be beneficial. Naturally, individuals should also act responsibly to address these problems, and the motivation to do this would hopefully arise if the measures described above are put into place by the government.

        "paragraphs": [
            "To what extent do you agree with such a procedure? Have you any reservations? The cloning of animals has been occurring for a number of years now, and this has now opened up the possibility of cloning humans too. Although there are clear benefits to humankind of cloning to provide spare body parts, I believe it raises a number of worrying ethical issues.",
            "Due to breakthroughs in medical science and improved diets, people are living much longer than in the past. This, though, has brought with it problems. As people age, their organs can fail so they need replacing. If humans were cloned, their organs could then be used to replace those of sick people. It is currently the case that there are often not enough organ donors around to fulfil this need, so cloning humans would overcome the issue as there would then be a ready supply. However, for good reasons, many people view this as a worrying development. Firstly, there are religious arguments against it. It would involve creating another human and then eventually killing it in order to use its organs, which it could be argued is murder. This is obviously a sin according to religious contexts. Also, dilemmas would arise over what rights these people have, as surely they would be humans just like the rest of us. Furthermore, if we have the ability to clone humans, it has to be questioned where this cloning will end. Is it then acceptable for people to start cloning relatives or family members who have died?",
            "To conclude, I do not agree with this procedure due to the ethical issues and dilemmas it would create. Cloning animals has been a positive development, but this is where it should end."

        "paragraphs": [
            "Today, computer technology is becoming more and more advanced. Many people think that it is wasteful to spend money on maintaining public libraries because most of their functions can be replaced with computer technology. However, I firmly believe that library should never be disregarded by our society. On one hand, the development of computer science has brought about lots of benefits to our lives. Anyone could obtain and store a great amount of information online easily instead of going to public libraries to search for them. People can also read books on the move with their mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads, and so on. Furthermore, people do not have to remember the deadline to return the books.",
            "On the other hand, public libraries still have several advantages over the Internet. First, a library always plays an important role as a reliable learning resource. Individuals could get access to sufficient data for their studies when they use public libraries. Second, individuals have more chances to make new friends and exchange learning experience when studying in a library. This opportunity can rarely be found on studying in front of a computer. Compared with only studying via the Internet, students could study in a more quiet and professional environment for academic purposes such as doing researches or graduate thesis.",
            "In conclusion, I believe that both public libraries and computer technology are necessary for people to expand their knowledge. Therefore, public libraries will not disappear or be replaced by computer science in the near future because of their unique features and benefits."

            "There are many things that artists can tell us about life that science and technology are not able to. To begin with, language, which is surprisingly a branch of art, gives people the sense of humanity, and differentiates human beings from animals. Furthermore, artists can boost our emotions and change our feelings with their artworks. For example, lots of Beethoven\u2019s fans feel relieved and motivated when they listen to his masterpieces.",
            "Another field in which we learn from art is related to culture and history. Many countries show their history through a piece of painting or the way that people perform their traditional dances in unique costumes. For instance, \u201cDong Ho\u201d paintings depict not only the daily life of Vietnamese people hundred years ago but also their dreams about a well-off life. For many people, exploring art is also one type of entertainment. There are people who travel around the world to visit historical places and art galleries, which helps them learn more about the culture and history of other nations. By contrast, science and technology are all about practical and physical aspects and contribute less to our lives emotionally and socially.",

            "There are several reasons why people believe that getting a job is the better choice. First, if people start to work at the age of 18, they could earn money on their own and be able to live independently without their parents\u2019 financial support. In fact, many students in Western countries tend to find a job after high school to afford their living. Second, people who choose to start their career early instead of going to university or college can have more opportunities to gain real experience and learn exclusive skills for their jobs. Therefore, this may bring out a good chance of getting promoted to higher positions such as managers or executives.",
            "On the other hand, I strongly believe that students would gain more benefits if they continue their studies. Firstly, a plenty of employers might ask for high academic qualifications from people applying for some professional jobs. For many high-paying jobs such as statisticians, economists, and medical jobs, master\u2019s degree is one of the most vital requirements. Secondly, today job market is more competitive and a bachelor\u2019s degree or master\u2019s degree in your resum\u00e9 can be a huge advantage compared to other applicants. Employers would prefer a person who has an adequate amount of knowledge to work efficiently with less training time.",

Modern parents are giving into children\u2019s demands and buy them all the latest toys and gadgets. I would argue that on no account can this parenting style bring any benefits for kids in the long run. Worse still, this negative education would cause detrimental consequences when they reach adulthood.",
        "paragraphs": [
            "First, over-indulgence can be harmful to young children, both socially and developmentally. When kids are provided with the latest must-have items, they are less likely to grasp the notion of sharing or appreciation for their parents\u2019 affection. Eventually, they interpret negative behaviours such as whining or begging as a way to manipulate others. In addition, little do the young ones comprehend the value of hard-earned money if adults keep showering them in spending splurges. Consequently, spoilt kids can become insensitive to the needs of others, are prone to temper tantrum and have trouble deferring gratification.",
            "Second, instant gratification could lead to adverse consequences in the future. Children who are spoiled do not have to learn responsible behaviours. Nor do they understand the concept of boundaries as adults and can develop problems such as gambling, overeating or drinking. Lacking in emotional maturity and having poor problem-solving skills, these adults might flounder and become unhappy with their lives. Furthermore, as over-indulged and over protected kids do not grasp the lesson of giving and taking in a relationship, they can have difficulty in establishing and maintaining meaningful friendships.",
            "In short, sometimes effective parenting skills involve resisting the desire to give kids whatever they want. Indeed, spoilt kids can lack life skills necessary to successfully negotiate the demands of adulthood given that their troubles have always been tackled by parents\u2019 money."

            "To begin with, there are a number of apparent reasons for keeping school leaving age to eighteen. First, it is of paramount importance to equip youngsters with fundamental life skills and knowledge so that they can enter the workforce as highly-qualified candidates. Working at an early age, albeit providing valuable hands-on experience, is likely to deter kids from pursuing higher education. In fact, without the proper education and training, rarely could children under eighteen make right career decisions as well as possess appropriate skill sets to negotiate higher base salary. Moreover, teenage years are theoretical milestones of adolescents\u2019 development in shaping their personality traits. Thus, only by staying in education under the guidance and orientation of adults could young people grasp moral behaviours and become law-abiding citizens.",
            "On the other hand, I strongly believe that not all children are obliged to attend a school until eighteen. A notable exception is for those with poor academic performance. There are multiple cases of successful entrepreneurs who drop out of school, yet managed to establish a thriving business without any formal education background. In other words, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Some individuals would learn best through direct contacts with real life circumstances. In addition, gifted kids with special talents should be noticed and nurtured in a different training course to boost their innate ability to the fullest. For example, a girl bestowed with a great voice should spend time on practicing singing skills so that her talent can prosper instead of learning subjects which are not her forte.",
            "In short, compulsory education until the age of eighteen is acceptable since children in teenage years still lack intellectual and emotional maturity. However, the essence of education is to tap into the potential in learners. Therefore, kids should be given the freedom to follow the most suitable learning path based on their individual style and inborn talents."

The comprehension of written words equip an individual the ability to understand what is read, and therefore he or she can pursue any area of life that they are interested in. Similarly, people with good writing skills are generally associated as more credible, more capable than those who frequently has typos and grammatical errors. The intrinsic value of literacy skills is to ensure effective communication in our daily lives. Secondly, compulsory algebra courses in the education system would nurture reasoning, analytical thinking which prepare our mind for real problems in life.",
            "On the other hand, there are a multitude of reasons why the introduction of computer studies at school is crucial in the era of information technology. Given the enormous amount of valuable material and knowledge available on the Internet, only when one is well-acquainted with basic digital skills, can they take advantage of the countless information resources worldwide. Lack of fundamental computer skills could be easily classified as the biggest culprit behind that cause one individual to lag behind their peers. In addition, proficiency in office-based applications such as Word, Powerpoint and Excel is one of the essential prerequisites if one aspires to thrive in the modern-day workplace. In other words, primary computer-related skills are inextricably linked with career progression as well as keeping apace with the surrounding world.",

It is said that a number of high schools are doing the bare minimum to equip students with the required skills for money management. In other words, state governments are focused on teaching the core subjects of Maths and English that personal finance often gets overlooked. In addition, parents today are not confident in their abilities to teach their kids about money management. Sadly enough, many parents have not learned critical financial values themselves; hence, they may be passing bad financial habits to their kids.",
            "In essence, most teenagers lack personal money management skill as noone around them talks about it. Therefore, it is vital for parents to use financial hardships and strained budgets as an opportunity to talk about finances and teach kids about managing money around the dinner table. Teenage kids should also be included in budget planning through a weekly or monthly allowance. Another feasible approach is the embedding of financial literacy course into the school curriculum. Amongst traditional core subjects, students should be required to complete personal-finance classes to graduate.",

In order to gain widespread popularity, private practices would employ well-qualified personnel and topnotch treatment facilities, attracting and retaining patients with competitive services. Consequently, by virtue of high-quality medical care and favorable staff\u2019s attitude, patients often choose to bypass free public clinic and opt for private doctors. Another argument in support of private services is the relatively substantial funding compared to public ones. Bountiful financial resources would eventually result in research findings on medicine and treatment for acute health problems, from which patients are intended beneficiaries. On the other hand, advocates of public sectors have highlighted inequities in access to health care resulting from the inability of the poor to pay for private services. There have been cases of private healthcare institutions charging exorbitant fees for medical treatments. Sadly though, the government has little control over the quality and the amount private hospitals and clinics charge the patients. In this situation, citizens are left at the whim of healthcare providers who are mostly driven by profit motives, rather than serving the ailing mankind. Furthermore, there are also moral and ethical issues regarding doctors and nursing staff in private sector. Some physicians would prescribe brand-name medications based on the commissions from pharmaceutical companies. In short, even though they offer better service and more cutting-edge medical equipment than their public-sector counterparts, negative aspects of the private providers such as overcharge and unethical staff overshadow the advantages."

Nearly every kind of habitat or ecosystem - be it land, air or water - has been affected by the uncontrollable destruction of habitats by human. The impact of humans taking land for buildings, farming and timber has rendered species extinct at speeds unprecedented in Earth\u2019s history. Besides, humans, due to their industrial, agricultural, or normal day-to-day activities, release an inordinate amount of toxic waste that is eventually dumped into the air, water or landfills. Tragedies like oil spills have been known to destroy and threaten many aquatic life forms.",
            "Having said that, rapid, greatly intensified efforts to address the problem, slowing the extinctions currently underway. First, each government should levy exorbitant fines on devastating behaviors such as littering, illegal dumping or other environmental offences. The implementation of stringent laws, accompanied by extensive media coverage of the issue would raise environmental awareness among all sections of the society. Second, international organizations such as the United Nations should coordinate activities among member countries as well as encourage participation by the private sector to promote sustainable use of the world\u2019s natural resources. Specifically, the presence of such inter-governmental organizations plays a major role in initiating negotiations on reducing industrial pollution level or other toxic waste.",

While some people argue that it is the duty of international organization, rather than a single country, to solve environment-related issues, I believe that both parties/ sides should join hands in solving this problem.",
            "On the one hand, many countries may share the same environmental concerns; however, they would stem from various causes. Therefore, each nation should implement different policies and measures to address the problem. For example, over-exploitation of natural resources and deforestation are identified as the biggest culprit for desertification in the USA; whereas, the growing rate of desertified land in China has been mainly caused by rapid urbanization. In addition, the priority regarding environmental issue is also varied in each country, calling for different approach and strategies to tackle the problem. To illustrate, in emerging economies such as Vietnam, reducing the worrying level of air pollution from industrial activities is of highest priority.",
            "On the other hand, the problems that each government is experiencing are indeed interconnected, hence, concerted efforts by all nations are necessary. Thus, international organizations such as the United Nations play a vital role in promoting and coordinate global action to reduce carbon footprint and curb the global warming threat. Furthermore, wealthy countries should provide financial and technological support for poor nations in the fight against green issues, since the detrimental effects of environmental problems could spread beyond national borders. In other words, an international effort is needed to yield an efficient environment protection scheme.",

            "To begin with, there are several explanations that are worth mentioning about this issue. The first reason is that due to the fast pace of modern life, people are now living a busier one and devoting an increasing amount of time to work. It is increasingly common that people tend to lose the balance between family and clerical work since they usually spend more time at work and do not come home until late at night. For example, due to the heavy workload many workers have to work more than 10 hours a day, and sometimes they are required to work during weekend or overnight to meet the deadline. The rapid development of social media is the second reason for this trend. That parents and children stay together but hold their own mobile phones or laptops to communicate with online friends on Facebook instead of talking with each other is easily seen these days.",
            "This rising issue is having considerable impacts on both individuals themselves and family. First, it is believed that family is where people can share their feelings and problems, which help them to release their stress. However, an individual may experience emotional distress if they do not receive proper support from his/ her immediate family. Second, the bonds between parents and children may be weakened. For instance, when parents do not spend much time with their children, their children will lack of appropriate parental care and attention and are likely to follow a path towards criminal behaviors.",

            "On the one hand, for the young generation spending too much time at the shopping malls can make them waste a great deal of money. As there are dozens of brands with various prices and design for them to choose from, they are easily tempted to buy things impulsively and misspend money on unnecessary stuff. For example, when some big brand names slash the prices, a shopaholic may purchase 10 shirts and jeans in a row and this cost her somewhere $100; however, such items often end up being left in the wardrobe. For the society, because youngsters are unlikely to participate in other activities such as their work or studying, economy may suffer due to less work being done and the youths could slack off their knowledge acquisition, making the national education standard drop significantly.",
            "On the other hand, there are also some advantages of this trend. First, in terms of the young, spending time at the malls is considered a method of relaxation. In modern life these days, young people have to deal with lots of pressure from school or workplace, so this trend helps them enjoy their life and effectively release their stress. Second, the society also benefits from this phenomenon. The increase in the amount of consumption will promote manufacture and commerce in the fashion industry, which afterward will create more jobs and boost the economic growth.",

Contrary to popular belief, landing on a job while studying - be it a part-time job or an apprenticeship, could easily distract youngsters from fulfilling their duties at school. In essence, in the current climate of obsession with early success, one is put under intense pressure to become successful artists, entrepreneurs and startup CEOs before the age 25, enjoying retirement with a generous income. That being said, that chilling reality could be a pipe dream for most. In fact, many well-paid jobs, such as doctors or lawyers, require a multi-year commitment to a long training course which can take up to 6 years or more, and thus, are not suitable for those who start working too early, yet lack formal education.",

I believe that people who remain in paid employment past retirement age or involved in community or voluntary work improve their chances of staying healthier for longer. Continuing to have a routine and going into a place of work each day can prevent the sense of loneliness that could come with retirement. Furthermore, by engaging in active employment, two problems are solved: the pension and the retirement savings crisis. Financial independence is the ultimate goal that everyone would pursue in order to live comfortably in older age.",

Ironically, the advent of the Internet is more of a mixed blessing. Indeed, the obvious merits of the world wide web cannot overshadow a worrying tendency of that growing addiction to electrical gadgets such as laptops, tablets or smartphones. Therefore, early exposure to the virtual world ended up erecting invisible boundaries, inducing kids\u2019 estrangement from actual human interactions.",

Consequently, parents would compel their offspring to enroll in highest-paying college majors, oblivious to their utmost passion. In addition, adult supervision seems to be extending into every aspect of children\u2019s lives. Take the recent arrest and jailing in US of a mother for abandoning her nine- year-old daughter to play alone in the park while she worked. In the current climate of obsession with children\u2019s safety, parents who let their youngsters out of sight court the accusation of irresponsibility, if not gross negligence. However, this school of thought may accidentally cause the erosion of children\u2019s freedom to engage with the world at will.",

For example, one can stay in constant touch with their loved ones via online messenger or video calls regardless of geographical barriers. In business context, rather than having to travel to specific location, people can plan to meet at times that work for all of their schedules. In addition, for professionals and academics, social networking sites allow users to create networks of like-minded people, expanding the horizons of what sort of contacts they can make in their professional lives.",

One issue with these digital forms of communication is that they are counter-intuitive, they have led to fewer interactions rather than encouraging frequent contacts of one person to another. Another negative impact of social networking technology is on interpersonal skills. It is a common sense to handle tough conversations such as breakup or getting fired in person. That being said, many opt for delivering the message online, avoiding the nerve-wracking feeling of telling someone bad news. In fact, the quality of decreasing conversations are suffering as well due to the prevalence of social networking.",

To start with, it is the globalization that impelled many corporations to become an international group, thereby making contribution to local technology and employment. Specifically, when a multinational group establishes a factory in a developing country, the new equipment, the new management skill and the job vacancies are all in the best interest of local society.

Consequently, by virtue of high-quality medical care and favorable staff\u2019s attitude, patients often choose to bypass free public clinic and opt for private doctors. Another argument in support of private services is the relatively substantial funding compared to public ones.

There have been cases of private healthcare institutions charging exorbitant fees for medical treatments. Sadly though, the government has little control over the quality and the amount private hospitals and clinics charge the patients. In this situation, citizens are left at the whim of healthcare providers who are mostly driven by profit motives, rather than serving the ailing mankind.

For example, modern road infrastructure has a crucial part to play in the rapid development of major cities in the world such as New York or Paris.

Compared to walking or cycling which leave little visual damage on road, cars definitely take up more space on city streets, and high demand for car use in everyday life causes road deterioration at an increasingly fast rate. For this reason, roadbuilding and expansion mostly facilitate drivers so that they can travel safely and smoothly. Besides, car owners normally have significantly higher income than others.

            "Whether the government budget should be invested in traffic infrastructure or public transport systems is open to debate. In my opinion, each has substantial contribution to the society; and therefore should receive equal fundings. To start with, better road quality would have an instant positive effect on the daily commute of citizens. In developing countries, it is relatively more convenient to travel by private vehicles in lieu of waiting for buses and trains with restricted routes and schedules. However, the staggering number of cars, motorbikes and scooters has led to one of most the aching issues in downtown areas which is urban traffic congestion in downtown areas. A feasible measure to this matter is that the authority should spend money on expanding road capacity and implement road improvement scheme. As a result, there will be more space for a larger volume of traffic and safer roads for all inhabitants. On the other hand, state funding for public transport is another radical resolution to the increasing traffic density. Take the metro systems in Hanoi which are currently under construction and projected to be in operation by 2020. Beside road building and maintenance, major cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh city invested a huge chunk of money in its metro projects to cope with heavy congestion and frequent traffic accidents. Moreover, better public transport system would create a major lifestyle shift, encouraging people to give up their private vehicles. In other words, promoting the use of public transport would dramatically alleviate air pollution particularly in emerging economies. In short, I believe that similar amount of money should be allocated to road and public transport to ensure smooth traffic flow."
