["In modern society , especially in big cities , undoubtedly hard work has become a very important feature of ordinary people\u2019s everyday life . It seems that many people are under the impression that their work is becoming more pressing and urgent , and thus they sacrifice more and more leisure time . In the first place , with the rapid development of science and technology , work today is more demanding than it used to be . For example , college graduates nowadays have to master English , computer science and driving skills before they can find decent jobs . People have to spend more time acquiring new techniques and skills . And their spare time tends to be fully occupied , not with leisure pursuit , but with work-related pursuits . In the second place , competition is becoming more intense . Many people feel anxious that they may be \u201claid-off\u201d if they can\u2019t work as hard as others . And they also feel at a disadvantage before new graduates . Therefore , it is understandable that people keep themselves involved in intensely hard work in order to preserve their positions . In my opinion , the worst aspect of this phenomenon is that the huge pressure of work will gradually affect people\u2019s mental health . Excessively hard work means that people can never get rid of the fatigue of their work , even in their leisure time . This means that they can not enjoy a normal life . In a word , in modern society overwork is stealing our leisure time", "There is much discussion nowadays as to whether or not the relation-ship between family members is as close as before . Diverse contributing factors can be identified . In the following , I would like to present my point of view . Great changes have taken place in family life along with the development of society . One of them is that the once-extended family tends to become smaller and smaller . Many children have to leave their parents at an early age to study or work elsewhere . As time passes , children become emotionally estranged from their parents . Compared with the past , social competition is becoming increasingly fierce . People are urged to concentrate their efforts upon work , so that they can achieve success , or at least a good standard of living . As a result , they can\u2019t afford to spend their leisure hours with their families . The importance of bonds of kinship is gradually fading from their minds . In addition , the availability of various kinds of recreational facilities also diverts people from enjoying chats with the members of their families . Their free time is mostly occupied by watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games . They come to lose interest in communicating with the other members of their families . In view of such alienation within families , urgent steps must be taken , in my opinion . For members of families who live away from one another , regular contact on the phone can bring them the care that they need . Family reunions on holidays or other important occasions can make a difference as well . For those living together , it is a good idea to take some time off work or recreation periods to spend more time with each other", "Today , education has become a priority for many parents seeking to secure a good future for their children in this rapidly changing world . They believe that if their children apply themselves and work hard at school , then they will increase their opportunities for going to higher education and eventually getting a good job . Of course they are right , and as access to the best education and best jobs is becoming more competitive , then it is true that children have to make the best of their study time when they are young . However , the parents who do not allow their children sufficient free time for leisure activities outside school hours , are misguided . Such activities are far from being a waste of time for the children simply because they are not academic . It is important to remember that children need to develop skills other than intellectual ones , and the best way to do this is through activities such as sports , games and playing with other kids . If they cannot play make-believe games , how can they develop their imagination? How can they learn physical co-ordination or learn important social lessons about winning and losing if they do not practise any sports? Many children form strong , personal relationships with the friends they play with , and without the opportunity to do this , they could grow up emotionally immature or unformed . Finally , I think it is also important to remember that children need to relax as well as work", "It has often been said that . Good news is bad news . because it does not sell newspapers . A radio station that once decided to present only good news soon found that it had gone out of business for lack of listeners . Bad news on the other hand is so common that in order to cope with it , we often simply ignore it . We have become immune to bad news and the newspapers and radio stations are aware of this . While newspapers and TV stations may aim to report world events accurately , be they natural or human disasters , political events or the horrors of war , it is also true that their main objective is to sell newspapers and attract listeners and viewers to their stations . For this reason TV and radio stations attempt to reflect the flavour of their station by providing news broadcasts tailor-made to suit their listeners . preferences . Programmes specialising in pop music or TV soap operas focus more on local news , home issues and up-to-date traffic reports . The more serious stations and newspapers like to provide . so called . objective news reports with editorial comment aimed at analysing the situation . If it is true , then , that newspapers and TV stations are tailoring their news to their readers . and viewers . requirements , how can they possibly be reporting real world events in an honest and objective light? Many radio and TV stations do , in fact , report items of good news but they no longer call this news . They refer to these as human interest stories and package them in programmes specialising , for instance , in consumer affairs or local issues . Good news now comes to us in the form of documentaries the fight against children", "Televisual media has become a pervasive force in the lives of families around the world today . Yet , a central question remains regarding whether watching television is harmful or beneficial for children . An analysis of this question reveals that television programs present three major concerns in the case of children , including depictions of violence , the use of profane language , and the representation of poor moral role models . Television programs that portray violence are a paramount concern for parents nowadays . Recent research has shown that children may commit acts of violence because they wish to emulate the behavior that they see on television . This is especially true when violent acts are committed by well-known action \u201cheroes . \u201d In addition , television programs show cartoon figures , as well as actors , committing violent acts . Using comic situations to depict violent themes causes further problems with the way in which young people view violence . Television programs that contain profane or disrespectful language also worry parents with young children . Because censorship laws have relaxed over the past few decades , it has become very common for television programs of each and every kind to show characters expressing impolite , rude , and insulting utterances to one another . Bearing resemblance to the case of portrayals of violence , children unfortunately often try to imitate these actions they watch on their television screens . Finally , some parents are upset about the moral behavior depicted on television . As they struggle to teach their children moral and ethical values , parents might despair about the lack of morals and ethics represented in some of the so-called role models on television . For instance , certain characters not only have no remorse for their immoral actions , but also frequently go unpunished by larger society . Because of these factors , many parents believe that television programs send their youth the wrong kinds of messages", "It has been around forty years since television was first introduced into Australian households and people today still have mixed views on whether it has a positive or a negative influence on the society . Many people believe that television damages culture . It promotes the stronger cultures of countries such as Britain and North America and weakens the cultures of less wealthy countries . This is because the stronger , wealthier countries are able to assert their own culture by producing more programs that are shown widely around the world . These programs then influence people , particularly young people , in the countries where they are shown . Also , because television networks need to attract large audiences to secure their financial survival , they must produce programs which are interesting to a broad range of people . In Australia this range is very broad because we are a multicultural society and people of all ages like to watch television . To interest all these different people , most television programs are short in length , full of action and excitement , do not require much intelligence or knowledge to understand , and follow universal themes common to all cultures , such as love and crime . Television programs which concentrate on or develop themes pertinent to one particular culture are not so successful because they interest a smaller audience . Nevertheless we much acknowledge that television does have some positive effects on the cultures within a society as well . People who do not live within their own culture can , in a limited way , access it through the multicultural station on the television . For example , Aboriginal children who have grown up in white families , or migrants and international students living in Australia , can watch programs from their own culture on the television", "I believe that child-rearing should be the responsibility of both parents and that , whilst the roles within that partnership may be different , they are nevertheless equal in importance . In some societies , it has been made easier over the years for single parents to raise children on their own . However , this does not mean that the traditional family , with both parents providing emotional support and role-models for their children , is not the most satisfactory way of bringing up children . Of crucial importance , in my opinion , is how we define 'responsible for bringing the children up' . At its simplest , it could mean giving the financial support necessary to provide a home , food and clothes and making sure the child is safe and receives an adequate education . This would be the basic definition . There is , however , another possible way of defining that part of the quotation . That would say it is not just the fathers responsibility to provide the basics for his children , while his wife involves herself in the everyday activity of bringing them up . Rather , he should share those daily duties , spend as much time as his job allows with his children , play with them , read to them , help directly with their education , participate very fully in their lives and encourage them to share his . It is this second , fuller , concept of 'fatherhood' that I am in favour of , although I also realise how difficult it is to achieve sometimes . The economic and employment situation in many countries means that jobs are getting more , not less , stressful , requiring long hours and perhaps long journeys to work as well", "I am not surprise when I read in the newspapers that many people move to English speaking countries . I am an engineer in a process control since ten years and I understand the necessity of English language . For example , when I read technical English specifications , when I meet Japanese Industrials to build together some electronic materials or when I go on holidays in Italy where the best way (for me) to communicate is to speak English . Therefore , today , it's necessary to learn English and the best way is to study in English as soon as possible when we are at school but also when we have a job . It's so Important to communicate with foreigners , because of work . For example: to seafoods in USA , to build electronic cards with the Japanese , to obtain a certification with FDA (American organization) in order to sell some pharmaceutical products . In fact , jt's Important for everybody , the workers , the visitors , the scientists , etc . These are the main reason which explain why so many people go to English speaking countries (the best way to learn) and why English is such an Important International language (the communication between many the people over the world) . This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6 score . Here is the examiner's comment: This response is underlength and is marked down because of this . Only a few relevant ideas are presented and these are used rather repetitively and are insufficiently developed or supported", "It is certainly very understandable that some governments should start looking at ways of limiting their populations to a sustainable figure . In the past , populations were partly regulated by frequent war and widespread disease , but in recent years the effects of those factors have been diminished . Countries can be faced with a population that is growing much faster than she nation's food resources or employment opportunities and whose members can be condemned to poverty by the need to feed extra mouths . They identify population control as a'means to raising living standards . But how should it be achieved? Clearly , this whole area is a very delicate personal and cultural issue . Many people feel that this is not a matter for the state . They feel this is one area of life where they have the right to make decisions for themselves . For that reason , it would seem that the best . approach would be to work by persuasion rather than compulsion This could be done by a process of education that points out the way a smaller family can mean an improved quality of life for the family members , as well as less strain on the country's perhaps very limited , resources . This is the preferred way . Of course if this docs not succeed within a reasonable time scale , it may be necessary to consider other measures . such as tax incentives or child-benefit payments for small families only . These are midway between persuasion and compulsion . So . yes . it is sometimes necessary , but governments should try very hard to persuade first", "The mass media have a powerful influence in shaping our lives . We have come to depend on them for information and entertainment , and in doing so we let them affect important aspects of our lives . The undeniable usefulness of the media in almost instantly providing information about events around the world is largely taken for granted . But in our dependence on the media we have allowed them to mould our notions and opinions of events , places and people . Though few of us probably think about it , our conceptions of , say , our elected officials spring from television images and newspaper stories . Most of us will never meet prime ministers or presidents , but anyone who is regularly exposed to the media will have an opinion of them . When it is time to cast our vote , we will make our decision based on how the media portray the candidates . We are similarly swayed by coverage of wars . The media , representing the values of their owners , societies and governments , tend to report wars with a bias; which is the 'good' side and which the 'bad' is determined for us by reporters , editors and commentators , and sure enough the public begins to form opinions that reflect the coverage they see , hear and read in the major media . The media are also influential in the way they facilitate the spread of culture and lifestyle . The so-called 'global youth culture' , in which one finds young people around the world displaying a common interest in music , clothing styles and films , is an example of the media's enormous sway in this regard . A popular figure such as Michael Jackson would never be so well known were it not for the media's extensive reach into every society on the globe . Thus I would argue that the mass media's influence is certainly great", "Anyone who lives in a city is aware of the increasing number of cars on the road and the kinds of problems this creates: traffic jams , air pollution and longer commuting periods . As economies grow and access to cars spreads to increasing numbers of people , this trend is likely to worsen . The solution , it would seem , is for governrnment to encourage the use of public transport in urban areas , thus decreasing dependence on the car . One way to stimulate public transport use is to make private car use more expensive and inconvenient . The introduction of tolls along urban motorways has been successfully employed in many cities . Other such measures are high-priced permits for parking in urban areas and the restriction of parking to a limited number of cars . Faced with high costs or no place to park , commuters would perhaps be more willing to abandon their cars in favour of buses or trains . There are also less punishing ways of spurring public transport use . The construction of free carparks at suburban train stations has proven successful in quite a number of countries . This allows commuters to drive part of the way , but take public transport into the central , most congested , urban areas . Indeed , making public transport more comfortable and convenient should work to attract more commuters and decrease traffic congestion . Public transport that is convenient and comfortable retains its passengers , much like any business that satisfies its customers", "The spread of telecommuting is sure to have far-reaching effects on society . By itself , telecommuting refers to offiice workers spending much of their time working from home and using electronic technologies to communicate with their employers . The broader implications of telecommuting , however , may involve changes to corporate structure , workers' lifestyles and even urban planning . The most obvious changes may be apparent in the `normal' offices of companies , governments and other organisations . If even half the working week is spent telecommuting from home , then we would initially expect many empty desks in the offiice . As offices grow smaller , workers coming in for the day would be expected to share desks with their absent colleagues . This , in turn , may affect the social atmosphere of an organisation , however , as less social contact with one's colleagues could harm morale and loyalty . For the individual office worker , telecommuting would mean spending more time at home . For a parent with young children , this may be a blessing . Moreover , many telecommuters would be able to work the hours they wished: having a nap in the afternrnoon , for example , but working some hours in the evening . One substantial benefit for all telecommuting workers is that there will be no need to travel to work , allowing more free time . The structure of urban life is also likely to be affected by telecommuting . We would expect to see fewer cars on the road during peak hours and , eventually , a smaller concentration of offiices in cities' central business districts . In short , people will have less reason to travel to city centres from outlying areas . As more people work and live in the same location , shops and cultural events will likely relocate themselves out of the city centre", "The view that women are better parents than men has shown itself to be true throughout history . This is not to say that men are not of importance in child- rearing indeed , they are most necessary if children are to appreciate fully the roles of both sexes . But women have proven themselves superior parents as a result of their conditioning , their less aggressive natures and their generally better communication skills . From the time they are little girls , females learn about nurturing . First with dolls and later perhaps with younger brothers and sisters , girls are given the role of carer . Girls see their mothers in the same roles and so it is natural that they identify this as a female activity . Boys , in contrast , learn competitive roles far removed from what it means to nurture . While boys may dream of adventures , girls' conditioning means they tend to see the future in terms of raising families . Girls also appear to be less aggressive than boys . In adulthood , it is men , not women , who prove to be the aggressors in crime and in war . Obviously , in raising children , a more patient , gentle manner is preferable to a more aggressive one . Although there certainly exist gentle men and aggressive women , by and large , females are less likely to resort to violence in attempting to solve problems . Finally , women tend to be better communicators than men . This is shown is intelligence tests , where females , on average , do better in verbal communication than males . Of course , communication is of utmost importance in rearing children , as children tend to learn from and adopt the communication styles of their parents", "Mandatory retirement age varies from society to society , perhaps a reflection of economics , population pressures or simply value systems . Indeed , retirement at 50 can probably be as easily justified as that at 70 . It is my belief , however , that the longer an able person is allowed to work , the better for both the individual worker and the employer . Chronological age is not always a true indicator of ability . While some 65\u00ac year-olds may not perform as well as they did in their past , many workers at this age do just as well or better than they used to . People's suitability for a position should be a reflection of their performance in the job , rather than the number of wrinkles or grey hairs they have . Employers concerned about the increasing age of their employees need only observe their work records . Those doing poorly may be asked to retire , but those as yet unaffected by age should stay on . Indeed , it would appear economical for an organisation to retain its older employees when possible rather than spend time and money on training new workers . Remaining in one's job for as long as one is able makes sense as life expectancies increase around the world . As people live longer , they are longer able to contribute to society in the form of meaningful work . But they are also in need of income for a longer period , so a mandatory retirement age of 55 for someone who is statistically likely to live to 77 becomes increasingly difficult to justify . At a time when populations are ageing , governments are less able to provide for their senior citizens , so by keeping able workers in paid employment for as long as is practicable , public expenditures are less strained . Thus , workers who can still demonstrate their capacity to carry out their work should not be asked to retire simply because they have reached a certain age", "Every four years , the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to make their country proud of them . These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in easing international tensions in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control the world's economy and other governments were fighting over land . The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can bring nations together , at least temporarily . From ancient History , when Greeks and Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games , to the more recent international disputes , when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their differences , compete pacifically and even embrace each other after an event . Moreover , these popular events have called the world's attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to accept agreements to end their dispute and live peacefully . Similarly , international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war . For example , Brazil has a high rate of unemployment , lack of education , hunger , crime , poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem . However , when the Football World Cup starts , the Brazilian squad , which is considered the best team in the world , provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country . Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases . They paint roads with the national colors , use wear the Brazilian team shirt and buy national flags . Moreover , the competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games and celebrate peacefully", "There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people's lives , especially in the field of education . Nowadays , an increasing number of students rely on computers to research for information and to produce a perfect paper for school purposes . Others have decided to leave the original way of learning to get knowledge through online schools . These changes in the learning process have brought a special concern regarding the possible decrease of importance of teachers in the classroom . Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been helping some students to progress in their studies quicker than when compared with an original classroom . For example , in the same classroom , students have different intellectual capacities , thus some would be tied to a slow advance in their studies because of others\u2019 incapacity of understanding . In this way , pupils could progress in their acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using computers instead of learning from teachers . However , the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact influences them in positive ways . Firstly , students realize that they are not dealing with a machine but with a human being who deserves attention and respect . They also learn the importance of studying in group and respect other students , which helps them to improve their social skills . Moreover , teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some student's deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same explanation , giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor . Hence , students can have a bigger chance not to fail in a subject", "\"Experience is the best teacher\" is an old clich\u00e9 , but I agree with it . We can learn a lot of important things from books , but the most important lessons in life come from our own experiences . Throughout the different stages of life , from primary school to university to adulthood , experience teaches us many skills we need for life . As children in primary school , we learn facts and information from books , but that is not all we learn in school . On the playground we learn how to make friends . In our class work , we learn how it feels to succeed and what we do when we fail . We start to learn about the things we like to do and the things we don't . We don't learn these things from books , but from our experiences with our friends and classmates . In our university classes , we learn a lot of information and skills we will need for our future careers , but we also learn a lot that is not in our textbooks . In our daily lives both in class and out of class , we learn to make decisions for ourselves . We learn to take on responsibilities . We learn to get along with our classmates , our roommates , and our workmates . Our successes and failures help us develop skills we will need in our adult lives . They are skills that no book can teach us . Throughout our adulthood , experience remains a constant teacher . We may continue to read or take classes for professional development . However , our experiences at work , at home , and with our friends teach us more . The triumphs and disasters of our lives teach us how to improve our careers and also how to improve our relationships and how to be the person each one of us wants to be . Books teach us a lot , but there is a limit to what they teach . They can give us information or show us another person's experiences", "Food is a basic part of life , so it follows that improved methods of food preparation have made our lives better . Nowadays we can prepare meals much faster than we could in the past . We can also enjoy a greater variety of food and eat more healthfully , all because of modern methods of food preparation . Microwave ovens have made it possible to prepare delicious food quickly . People these days rarely have time to shop and prepare meals the old-fashioned way . We live very fast lives . We are busy working , caring for our families travelling , playing sports , and many other things . Because of microwave ovens , we have time to enjoy a good meal with our family and then play soccer , go to a movie , study , or do anything else we want to afterwards . Modern methods of preserving food have made it possible to enjoy a wide variety of food . Because of refrigerators , freezers , canning , and freeze-drying , we can eat fruits and vegetables that come from far away places . We can prepare a meal one day and save the leftovers in the refrigerator or freezer to eat at another time . We can keep different kinds of food in the refrigerator or on the shelf . Its easy to always have food available and to be able to eat completely different meals every day . Healthful eating is easier now than it ever was . Because of modern transportation methods , fresh fruits and vegetables are available all year round . Modern kitchen appliances make it easy to prepare fruits and vegetables fro cooking . Bread machines make it possible to enjoy healthful , home-baked bread whenever we like . We can eat fresh and healthful food everyday because modern methods have made preparation easy . Our lifestyle is fast , but people still like good food . New food preparation methods have given us is more choices", "Parents shape their children from the beginning of their children's lives . They teach their children values . They share their interests with them . They develop close emotional ties with them . Parents can be very important teachers in their children's lives; however , they are not always the best teachers . Parents may be too close to their children emotionally . For example , they may limit a child's freedom in the name of safety . A teacher may organize an educational trip to a big city , but a parent may think this trip is too dangerous . A school may want to take the children camping , but a parent may be afraid of the child getting hurt . Another problem is that parents sometimes expect their children's interests to be similar to their own . If the parents love science , they may try to force their child to love science too . But what if the child prefers art? If the parents enjoy sports , they may expect their child to participate on different teams . But what if the child prefers to read? Parents want to pass on their values to their children . However , things change . The children of today are growing up in a world different from their parents' world . Sometimes parents , especially older ones , can't keep up with rapid social or technological changes . A student who has friends of different races at school may find that his parents have narrower views . A student who loves computers may find that her parents don't understand or value the digital revolution . Parents are important teachers in our lives , but they aren't always the best teachers . Fortunately , we have many teachers in our lives . Our parents teach us , our teachers teach us , and we learn from our peers . Books and newspapers also teach us", "People attend college for a lot of different reasons . I believe that the three most common reasons are to prepare for a career , to have new experiences , and to increase their knowledge of themselves and of the world around them . Career preparation is probably the primary reason that people attend college . These days , the job market is very competitive . Careers such as information technology will need many new workers in the near future . At college , students can learn new skills for these careers and increase their opportunities for the future . Students also go to college to have new experiences . For many , it is their first time away from home . At college , they can meet new people from many different places . They can see what life is like in a different city . They can learn to live on their own and take care of themselves without having their family always nearby . At college , students have the opportunity to increase their knowledge . As they decide what they want to study , pursue their studies , and interact with their classmates , they learn a lot about themselves . They also , of course , have the opportunity to learn about many subjects in their classes . In addition to the skills and knowledge related to their career , college students also have the chance to take classes in other areas . For many , this will be their last chance to study different subjects . Colleges offer much more than career preparation . They offer the opportunity to have new experiences and to learn many kinds of things", "It is certainly true that the position of women in society has undergone a dramatic change in the past twenty years but I do not feel that this is a direct cause of the indisputable increase in juvenile-related problems during this period . It is now accepted that young women should find work on leaving school; indeed to rely totally on their parents' financial support is no longer an option in many families . Likewise , once they get married , the majority of women continue working since the financial pressures of setting up a house and establishing a reasonable standard of living often require two incomes . Twenty years ago it was common for women to give up work once they had children and devote their time to caring for their children . This is no longer the general rule and the provision of professionally-run child care facilities and day nurseries have removed much of the responsibility for child rearing that used to fall to mothers . However , these facilities come at a cost and often require two salaries coming into a family to be afforded . I do not believe that the increase in the number of working mothers has resulted in children being brought up less well than previously . Indeed it could be argued that by giving mothers the opportunity to work and earn extra money children can be better provided for than previously . There is more money for luxuries and holidays and a more secure family life is possible . Of course there are limits as to the amount of time that ideally should be spent away from home and the ideal scenario would be for one of the parents (often the wife) to have a part-time job and thus be available for their children before and after school", "There are some conditions under which a novelist could reasonably expect some government suport . In general terms , if the writer has already proved that he or she can write well , and if the stories produced are stimulating and interesting , then I consider that some financial help might be given . Language quality is difficult to define , but if the writing shows , for example , good grammar , a wide vocabulary , and elegance and imagination , then I can see a valid reason for assisting an author to spend some time free from money problems . Such a writing needs to be encouraged . the entertainment value of a book would be also a factor in deciding whether to provide assistance to an author . Further consideration would include social and educational values expressed in the author's work . However , if the ideas were socially irresponsible , or if the stories contain unnecessary violence or pornography for its own sake , then I would not want to see the author sponsored to write stories which do not benefit society . Other exceptions are the many writers of good books who do not require financial help . Books which proved to be extremely popular , such as the Harry Potter stories , clearly need no subsidy at all because the authors have become rich through their writing . Views on what good quality writing means will vary widely , and so if any author is to be given money for writing , then the decision would have to be made by a committee or panel of judge", "The salaries of many singers , dancers and sports people have increased out of all proportion in recent years , while in places like Sudan people are starving to death . I do not beleive that anyone should be able to earn such enormous salaries whan so many people in the world are living in poverty . One af the factors which should affect what a person can earn ought to be the benefit of person's work to society . It is unreasonable for a famous singer to be able to earn far more from an evening's entertainment than , for instance , a medical scientist who develops a new drug which produces a treatment for a common disease . The pop star certainly has a value in society , but the value in no way exceeds , or even matches , the value gained from a successful medication . Secondly . work done should be paid according to the amount of effort and skill that goes into it . Nobody would deny that a famous person works hard and is skillful , yet such people do not work any harder than thousand of other workers who have no claim to fame . Yet market force are such that these superstarts can obtain millions of dolor while other unknown people sometimes earn less than they need to survive . Finally , it should be possible for governments to work together to ensure that the amount of money in circulation should be more more equally and fairly distributed . This seems only fair given that there are so many suffering", "Everyone has the choice of being a smoker or not . The people who choose to smoke do so knowing there is a risk of causing harmful damage to themselves . However , I do not entirely agree that these people should have to pay more to receive all the medical treatment they need . I think there are many situations in which a medical problem has nothing to do with whether a person smokes or not . In these cases , where an illness has no relation to smoking , then I believe that smokers should not be required to pay more than other people for their medical treatment . Most car accidents , for example , have no connection with smoking , and the people who are injured ought to have the same medical help , regardless of the cost . And what about the common flu - it does not seem justifiable to me that a smoker should have to pay more to see a doctor for an illness we can all contract . On the other hand , I agree that a smoker should pay more than a non-smoker for the necessary treatment of any condition which has been caused by smoking . The principle that people should take responsibility for their own actions is a good one . Consequently , if a person chooses to smoke knowing that this habit can cause serious health problems , then there is no reason why the community or an insurance company should have to pay for medical treatment for an illness which could have been avoided . In many countries , cigarette packets have a clear warning that smoking can cause health problems and so no smoker can claim not to know the danger . Lung cancer is sometimes a fatal disease and the treatment is both lengthy and expensive , and it is unfair for the smoker to expect the hospital or the community to carry the cost . In fact , it could also be argued that those who smoke in public should be asked to pay extra because of the illness caused to passive smokers", "Computers are a relatively new invention . The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life . Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties . In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives . We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them . You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide . In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers . The prospects for this are quite alarming . They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work . They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos . They will , for example , be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport . Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong . If one small program fails disaster . There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex . We should , however , ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology . It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us", "The issue of whether we should force parents to immunise their children against common diseases is , in my opinion , a social rather than a medical question . Since we are free to choose what we expose our bodies to in the way of food , drink , or religion for that matter , why should the question of medical 'treatment' be any different? Medical researchers and governments are primarily interested in overall statistics and trends and in money-saving schemes which fail to take into consideration the individual's concerns and rights . While immunisation against diseases such as tetanus and whooping cough may be effective , little information is released about the harmful effects of vaccinations which can sometimes result in stunted growth or even death . The body is designed to resist disease and to create its own natural immunity through contact with that disease . So when children are given artificial immunity , we create a vulnerable society which is entirely dependent on immunisation . In the event that mass immunisation programmes were to cease , the society as a whole would be more at risk than ever before . In addition there is the issue of the rights of the individual . As members of a society , why should we be obliged to subject our children to this potentially harmful practice? Some people may also be against immunisation on religious grounds and their needs must also be considered", "Some people argue that the state does not have the right to make parents immunise their children . However , I feel the question is not whether they should immunise but whether , as members of society , they have the right not to . Preventative medicine has proved to be the most effective way of reducing the incidence of fatal childhood diseases . As a result of the widespread practice of immunising young children in our society , many lives have been saved and the diseases have been reduced to almost zero . In previous centuries children died from ordinary illnesses such as influenza and tuberculosis and because few people had immunity , the diseases spread easily . Diseases such as dysentery were the result of poor hygiene but these have long been eradicated since the arrival of good sanitation and clean water . Nobody would suggest that we should reverse this good practice now because dysentery has been wiped out . Serious diseases such as polio and smallpox have also been eradicated through national immunisation programmes . In consequence , children not immunised are far less at risk in this disease-free society than they would otherwise be . Parents choosing not to immunise are relying on the fact that the diseases have already been eradicated . If the number of parents choosing not to immunise increased , there would be a similar increase in the risk of the diseases returning . Immunisation is not an issue like seatbelts which affects only the individual . A decision not to immunise will have widespread repercussions for the whole of society and for this reason , I do not believe that individuals have the right to stand aside", "There is no doubt that some students in schools behave badly and their behaviour causes difficulty for others either because it has a negative effect on the group or because ordinary students find it difficult to study with them . One solution is to take these students away and teach them on their own . However , if we simply have them removed after one or two warnings , we are limiting their educational opportunities because it seems to me that a school which caters for difficult students is a sort of \"prison\" whatever name you give it and the people who go there may never recover from the experience . This can then cause problems for the wider society . Perhaps we need to look at why the disruptive students behave badly before we separate them . Disruptive students may be very intelligent and find the classes boring because the work is too easy . Perhaps these students need extra lessons rather than separate lessons . Or perhaps the teachers are uninspiring and this results in behavioural problems so we need better teachers . On the other hand , most students put up with this situation rather than cause trouble , and some people argue that we have to learn to suffer bad teachers and boring situations and that students who can't learn this lesson need to be taught separately", "Social welfare is an essential element of an advanced society . Good systems are always abused , but that does not mean they are faulty . In my opinion , the two main reasons why welfare payments are necessary are as follows: First of all , critics forget that there are many forms of welfare besides payments to the unemployed . Their negative opinions harm those who are not capable of earning a wage , such as single-parent mothers , the disabled , and the sick . Moreover , the unemployed have the right to an income , too . They are not always at fault for not having a job , and in most cases the tax they have paid in the past entitles them to assistance . The second reason is that crime increases when people have no means of support . The desperately poor inevitably turn to crime , which is not only dangerous but costly . Policing the streets is more expensive than providing welfare . A policeman's wage is four or five times higher than a \"dole\" payment . Certain members of society believe that people should look after themselves . They point out that welfare increases dependency on others and destroys dignity . This may be true , but in the case of the unemployed , the relief payments are usually temporary . It is surely the fault of the government if there are long-term unemployed . Welfare critics also believe that it is the responsibility of a victim's family to provide financial assistance . However , it is too expensive to provide complete help for a severely disabled person . To conclude , it is vital to understand the need for welfare in a modern democratic society . Without welfare payments the poor are destined to become poorer", "Studying a language in a country where it is widely spoken has many advantages . It is , therefore , a good idea to study English in a country such as Britain . However , I believe it is not the only way to learn the language . In the first place , most students in non-English-speaking countries learn English at secondary school , and sometimes at university nowadays . Although their spoken English is not usually of a very high standard , their knowledge of grammar is often quite advanced . This is certainly useful when students come to an English-speaking country to perfect the language . Secondly , studying the basics of English at secondary school is less stressful than learning the language while overseas . This is because students living at home do not have to worry about problems such as finding accommodation , paying for their study and living costs , and trying to survive in a foreign country where day to day living causes much stress . However , there are obvious advantages of learning English in Britain . Every day there are opportunities to practise listening to and speaking with British people . Also , students can experience the culture firsthand , which is a great help when trying to understand the language . This is especially true if they choose to live with a British family , as exchange students for example . Furthermore , if students attend a language school full-time , the teachers will be native speakers . In this case , not only will students' speaking and listening skills improve , but attention can be given to developing reading and writing skills as well", "In most countries of the world the population is increasing alarmingly . This is especially true in poor , undeveloped countries . Overpopulation causes a considerable number of problems . In poor countries it is difficult to provide enough food to feed even the present number of people . In addition , education to limit the number of children per family is not always successful . Poorer countries usually have a lot of unemployment too , and an increase in population simply makes the situation worse . The environment also suffers when there are too many people living on the land . In rich , industrialised and developing countries it is very difficult for governments to provide effective public services in overcrowded cities . Moreover , there is usually a great deal more crime , which is often due to high rates of unemployment . Further large increases in population only cause more overcrowding , unemployment and crime . There are two main solutions to the overpopulation problem . Firstly , every woman who is pregnant , but who does not want to give birth , should be allowed by law to have an abortion . Secondly , governments must educate people to limit the size of the family . In China , couples are penalised financially if they have more than one child . This may seem cruel , but the \"one-child policy\" is beginning to have an effect in the world's most populous nation . Eventually , similar policies might also be necessary in other crowded nations such as India , for example", "Youth drug abuse is a serious problem nowadays in many cultures . Not only is illegal drug use on the rise , but children as young as 10 years old are experimenting with alcohol and tobacco . The reasons for this behaviour are unclear , but certain sociologists blame the examples set by their elders . Parents who drink and smoke to excess are , in effect , telling their children that it is acceptable to abuse their bodies with drugs . Consequently , children may have a similar view towards illegal drugs , even if their parents are against their use . In addition , drug use shown on television and in films can only confuse children who are also taught at school that drug abuse is wrong . The pressure on young people to perform well at school in order to compete for jobs is a possible cause of the problem . Many believe they cannot live up to their parents' expectations , and feel a sense of hopelessness . Also , the widespread availability of drugs means teenagers are faced with the temptation to experiment . Drugs are used as a means of expressing dissatisfaction with the pressures they face in society . The effects of drug abuse are well known . Many young people's talents are wasted , and addiction to hard drugs can cost a user his or her life . Furthermore , those who drink and drive may be involved in fatal road accidents . The cost to society is great , and enormous amounts of money are spent on convicting drug dealers and on education programmes", "These days , many people are afraid of nuclear technology because of the dangers associated with its use . In my opinion , although it is true that nuclear weapons pose the greatest threat to life , the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes also carries some serious risks . Nuclear power stations provide an important source of cheap power for many industrialised nations and some developing countries . However , there is always the danger of radiation leaking from these plants . Even though safety precautions are taken , there have been numerous disasters such as the explosion of a nuclear plant in Russia not long ago . Nuclear technology is even used to help cure some diseases such as cancer . Radiation can be applied to the body to burn away cancerous cells . This is , however , a dangerous procedure , and the application of radiation is almost always painful and not always successful . The most worrying aspect of nuclear technology , though , is its use for military purposes . Enough atomic bombs have already been built to completely destroy the planet , and the real danger is that one day some country will start a war with these weapons . Too many countries now have the technology required to make such bombs , and there is currently much debate about how to control the situation . In conclusion , nuclear technology certainly has positive uses , but is , nonetheless , dangerous . However , it would have been better if it had never been used to create nuclear weapons", "It is generally accepted that we all need leisure time to recover from the stresses of work and everyday life . Personally , I prefer to be active during this time , as I think this suits me better . However , what we do with our leisure time is up to us and no one can say that any particular activity is the best . Some people relax by watching movies , reading or surfing the internet . People who have physically demanding jobs may choose these types of activities . If you are a nurse or builder , you may feel that you don't want to do a five-kilometre run after work , because you are already physically tired . Other people do very sedentary jobs . Computer analysts , for example , may spend all day sitting in front of a computer screen . At the end of the working day , they may be keen to stretch their limbs and improve their health by swimming or going to the gym . Another factor that influences our choice of leisure pursuit is where we work . People who work indoors often prefer outdoor hobbies , whereas for people who work outdoors , the reverse may be true . I am a student myself and this involves a lot of sitting in lectures , so I need to get out into the fresh air afterwards . In any situation , the important thing is that people need to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them", "It is true that illiteracy is becoming a serious problem in industrialised nations . This is surprising as most people think that this is a problem only in under-developed nations such as in parts of Africa and India . Illiteracy is related to many other problems such as poverty , over-population and governmental corruption . Let us take a more detailed look at the causes of this growing problem in many Western nations . One of the most obvious reasons for the increase in illiteracy is the advent of television . Children no longer have to read to obtain information . Neither do they have to read to relax . Today children get home from school and go straight to \u201cthe box\u201d to watch their favorite program . Watching television is much easier and more exciting than reading . Another reason for the increase in illiteracy is the fact that so many women work . This means that children are often alone at home and so they are unsupervised . When parents get home they are often too tired to spend quality time whit their children . It is also true that many people blame schools for the decline in illiteracy . In many countries there has been a move away from teaching basic skills such as reading and writing . There are many effects of this growing illiteracy rate . The most obvious is unemployment . This may in turn lead to alcohol and drug abuse . Ultimately the economy of the country begins to suffer and there is a drop in living standards . To address this problem , parents need to become more aware of their responsibilities and schools need to consider a change in their teaching methods", "If I could change one thing about my hometown , I think it would be the fact that there\u2019s no sense of community here . People don\u2019t feel connected , they don\u2019t look out for each other , and they don\u2019t get to know their neighbors . People come and go a lot here . They change jobs frequently and move on . This means that they don\u2019t put down roots in the community . They don\u2019t join community organizations and they\u2019re not willing to get involved in trying to improve the quality of life . If someone has a petition to put in a new street light , she has a very hard time getting a lot of people to sign . They don\u2019t feel it has anything to do with them . They don\u2019t get involved in improving the schools because they don\u2019t think the quality of education is important to their lives . They don\u2019t see the connection between themselves and the rest of their community . People don\u2019t try to support others around them . They don\u2019t keep a friendly eye on their children , or check in on older folks if they don\u2019t see them for a few days . They\u2019re not aware when people around them may be going through a hard time . For example , they may not know if a neighbor loses a loved one . There\u2019s not a lot of community support for individuals . Neighbors don\u2019t get to know each other . Again , this is because people come and go within a few years . So when neighbors go on vacation , no one is keeping an eye on their house . No one is making sure nothing suspicious is going on there , like lights in the middle of the night . When neighbors\u2019 children are cutting across someone\u2019s lawn on their bikes , there\u2019s no friendly way of casually mentioning the problem . People immediately act as if it\u2019s a major property disagreement", "\u201cExperience is the best teacher\u201d is an old clich\u00e9 , but I agree with it . The most important , and sometimes the hardest , lessons we learn in life come from our participation in situations . You can\u2019 learn everything from a book . Of course , learning from books in a formal educational setting is also valuable . It\u2019s in schools that we learn the information we need to function in our society . We learn how to speak and write and understand mathematical equations . This is all information that we need to live in our communities and earn a living . Nevertheless , I think that the most important lessons can\u2019t be taught; they have to be experienced . No one can teach us how to get along with others or how to have self-respect . As we grow from children into teenagers , no one can teach us how to deal with peer pressure . As we leave adolescence behind and enter adult life , no one can teach us how to fall in love and get married . This shouldn\u2019t stop us from looking for guidelines along the way . Teachers and parents are valuable sources of advice when we\u2019re young . As we enter into new stages in our lives , the advice we receive from them is very helpful because they have already bad similar experiences", "Throughout my life , I have been lucky enough to have a very good relationship with my parents . They have supported me , given me necessary criticism , and taught me a great deal about how to live my life . Parents can be very important teachers in our lives; however , they are not always the best teachers . Parents may be too close to their children emotionally . Sometimes they can only see their children though the eyes of a protector . For example , they may limit a child\u2019s freedom in the name of safety . A teacher might see a trip to a big city as a valuable new experience . However , it might seem too dangerous to a parent . Another problem is that parents may expect their children\u2019s interests to be similar to their own . They can\u2019t seem to separate from their children in their mind . If they love science , they may try to force their child to love science too . But what if their child\u2019s true love is art , or writing , or car repair? Parents are usually eager to pass on their value to their children . But should children always believe what their parents do? Maybe different generations need different ways of thinking . When children are young , they believe that their parents are always rights . But when they get older , they realize there are other views . Sometimes parents , especially older ones , can\u2019t keep up with rapid social or technology changes . A student who has friends of all different races and backgrounds at school may find that her parents don\u2019t really understand or value the digital revolution . Sometimes kids have to find their own ways to what they believe in . The most important thing to realize is that we all have many teachers in our lives . Our parents teach us , our teachers teach us , and our peers teach us . Books and newspapers and television also teach us", "People attend colleges or universities for a lot of different reasons . I believe that the three most common reasons are to prepare for a career , to have new experiences , and to increase their knowledge of themselves and the world around them . Career preparation is becoming more and more important to young people . For many , this is the primary reason to go to college . They know that the job market is competitive . At college , they can learn new skill for careers with a lot of opportunities . This means careers , such as information technology , that are expected to need a large workforce in the coming years . Also , students go to colleges and universities to have new experiences . This often means having the opportunity to meet people different from those in their hometowns . For most students , going to college is the first time they\u2019ve been away from home by themselves . In additions , this is the first time they\u2019ve had to make decisions on their own . Making these decisions increases their knowledge of themselves . Besides looking for self-knowledge , people also attend a university or college to expand their knowledge in subjects they find interesting . For many , this will be their last chance for a long time to learn about something that doesn\u2019t relate to their career . I would recommend that people not be so focused on a career", "I think it is true that in almost every country today each household and family produces a large amount of waste every week . Most of this rubbish comes from the packaging from the things we buy , such as processed food . But even if we buy fresh food without packaging , we still produce rubbish from the plastic bags used everywhere to carry shopping home . The reason why we have so much packaging is that we consume so much more on a daily basis than families did in the past . Convenience is also very important in modern life , so we buy packaging or canned food that can be transported from long distances and stored untill we need it , first in the supermarket , and then at home . However , I think the amount of waste produce is also a result of our tendency to use something once and throw it away . We forget that even the cheapest plastic bag has used up valuable resources and energy to produce . We also forget that it is a source of pollution and difficult to dispose of . I think , therefore , that governments need to raise this awareness in the general public . Children can be educated about environmental issues at school , but adults need to take action . Governments can encourage such action by putting taxes on packaging , such as plastic bags , by providing recycling services and by thing households and shops that do not attempt to recycle their waste . With the political will , such measures could really reduce the amount of rubbish we produce", "Holidays are important because they provide a break from our normal daily routine and from the world of work . Traditionally , holidays have been seen as a time for relaxation and as an opportunity to visit another country in order to find out about its geography and customs . Nowadays , however , it seems that other types of holiday are becoming popular . Some people want their holiday to be a kind of adventure , and find this more exciting than going to the beach or visiting museums . On an adventure holiday , you may stay in quite basic accommodation , rather than a luxurious hotel . Activities may involve things such as bush walking or cycling , or may form part of an aid project designed to help communities in remote areas . Holidays such as these are popular with people of all ages and can often help to promote tourism in rural environments . The increasing popularity of dangerous sports has also boosted the number of adventure holidays; for example , water sports , mountain climbing or paragliding . These holidays are more popular with the younger generation , as they can be both physically and mentally demanding . Participants are often seeking the sort of thrills that they cannot get in ordinary life . There is now greater awareness of the damaging effects of mass tourism and this may be one reason for the changing nature of holidays . This can only be a good thing", "The idea that a marriage should be arranged by the parents of the couple , or by other members-of the family , is quite acceptable to some societies , yet completely out of the question for others . It all depends on your cultural expectations . In so-called western societies , it is very unusual for marriages to be arranged . Most young people would not welcome the idea that their parents have the right to choose their partner for life . They feel that arranged marriages deny them their fundamental right to choose , even if they make a bad decision . However , if we are honest about it , we might acknowledge that some parents organise their children's lives in such a way that they are likely to meet and marry partners the parents approve o\u00a3 It could be said that this is , to some extent , similar to an arranged marriage . It is always better when families support the relationship and welcome the grandchildren . People for whom arranged marriages are the cultural norm often argue that the likelihood of the marriage lasting is greater when it is set up in this manner . Parents can be assured that their children are joining a family of similar standing and cultural background , and this , in the long run , makes for a more stable society if your parents' marriage was arranged , and has worked well , then why should you question the custom? The important thing to ensure is that people are never forced into a marriage which will make them unhappy or lead to an unequal relationship where one partner is exploited by the other", "I certainly agree that people who come up with new ideas; in other words those who 'invent' or 'discover' things are terribly important to society as a whole . However , I also think there is a role in society for good imitators . No one would deny that key individuals must be thanked for providing us with certain facilities that we use every day . Where , would we be , for example , without basic items such as the washing machine , the television and , more recently , the computer? These items are now used so regularly that we tend to take them for granted . In fact , the society we live in today has become increasingly consumer-oriented , and while it may be possible to constantly update and improve consumer goods , not everyone where I live can afford the prices of these innovations . Furthermore not everyone lives in an area that has accessibility to the latest models on the market . For this reason , there is a value to be placed on being able to provide good copies of expensive items . Having said that , certain innovations have a more serious impact on our lives than consumer goods and cannot easily be replicated . Vital medicines like penicillin and vaccines against dangerous diseases also exist because people made continual efforts to develop them", "The advanced `Mind machines' so called `the Computers' are no doubt the best products of latest technology . One cannot imagine the advancement of life and Sciences without these machines . But like other achievements; they have their own good and bad effects as seen with experience and passage of time . In my opinion they are good if used for educational and beneficial uses for health and living etc . Basically twentieth century had been famous for its latest Computer techniques and their application on our lives . Datas shown on Computers help us to assess how much education is conducted through this media . The assessment ways as well as examinations are improved . Moreover personal skills of reading and writing are far more improved through Computers . Moreover Science and technology progressed immensely with computers . Researchers like cloning and transplants are only possible with modern computerized skills . Good question comes to ones mind . where will this Computer would take us next?? Certainly no one knows! We might explore new planners . May be we will buy houses on Moon , Mars or Jupitor . Or we might loose our own identity . One cannot forget the end of 2000 millennium when everybody was in chaos to think what will happen if the computers crash? The aeroplanes were going to crash and the trains would colloid . That Show we are forced to think that one should not be dependent on these machine after all we are humans", "Nowadays , as roads are becoming more and more crowded , people are considering both the advantages and disadvantages of having a car before they buy one . The main advantage of the car is that it gives the freedom to travel when and where you want , without being limited to fixed routes and timetables . What is more , you can carry several passengers and as much luggage as you like , at no extra cost . In addition to this , you can travel in comfort in a car , with a seat to yourself and the possibility of comforts such as a music system and air conditioning . On the other hand , owning a car is very expensive . As well as the price of the car , the cost of tax , insurance , petrol and repairs must also be considered before buying . Moreover , the increase in traffic means that drivers are spending more and more time stuck in traffic jams . Perhaps the major disadvantage of cars in general is the huge damage that they do to human life and to the environment , and all motorists much accept that they are making a small contribution to this", "In our daily life , we always communicate information through the media , such as television , radio , film , These media have different advantages and disadvantages for us . Now , I am going to compare the advantages and disadvantages of books , television and film . Books bring us different knowledge . It bases on what Book we read . A famous Chinese traditional verse which described books is a treasure . We can find a golden house in there . Moreover , when we want to read it , we can find it easily , such as bookstore , library . We can also learn a lot of words from books . And it can improve our reading and writing skills . However , books always are not attractive for children or youngster . It is because books are quite boring . A lot of words and less pictures inside the books , compare to television , television has pictures and sound , we don't have to read a lot of words in television . But some artist in television programme or film , bring a bad image to us . Then some children or youngers will imitate their behaviour . Some film also bring a wrong message to us , For example , they are always smoking in films . It seems that smoking is good and smart . It caused many youngers imitate them smoking . In conclusion , bookds , television and film have many advantages and disadvantages . I cannot write all in here", "Nobody can say with confidence that children should be taught at home or at any children's institutions . There are many different children and every one demand of education suitable only for him . But for most of children the best way of learning the life is being in the children's institutions . Nobody would argue that contacts between children of the same age are very important for bringing your child up . Such a contact is very important for playing , entertaining and learning living with other people . The harmonious living with other people , to my mind , is the first task for any man . Lack of this harmony sets problems and troubles . The children need space to run and make noise , to jump and cry . Do you or your neighbours allow these actions for your child? If you live in town , it is difficult to find a safe place to play . Kindergartens give such a possibility . They give space , a lot of toys and constructions for physical exercises . So , if you have bad living conditions , the kindergarten is the best way for you . But if you have a large family with many children and enough space , you may keep your child at home . You should be sure that the child feels , dressed and comfortable . His brothers and sisters give him necessary contacts . It's noticed long ago that children in big families are much more easy-tempered and calm . They are located in more harmonic world than others . Sometimes differences in age put troubles in contacts between children in large families . Then it is better for child to be sent to the kindergarten (school) . But if quarrels don't last for a long time , everything is all right . In general , quarrels develop ability to cooperate with people . They develop a personal initiative and force setting the balance . In such a way the child gets lessons of life . Addly , the quarrels often take place in kindergartens and schools and we shouldn't fear it . Side by side with quarrels parents often are afraid of colds which happen in kindergartens more frequently . Parents prefer keeping the child at home . But for a healthy child odd cold (if illness occurs , it goes its normal course) can't make big harm to the child . And if the child is adaptable to the conditions of public places earlier it would be better for him in future . In general , I am a follower of the theory of keeping children in adapted places such as good kindergartens . But keeping children in such a place can't replace family and home", "Today the way we consider human psychology and mental development is heavily influenced by the genetic sciences . We now understand the importance of inherited characteristics more than ever before . Yet we are still unable to decide whether an individual\u2019s personality and development are more influenced by genetic factors (nature) or by the environment (nurture) . Research , relating to identical twins , has highlighted how significant inherited characteristics can be for an individual's life . But whether these characteristics are able to develop within the personality of an individual surely depends on whether the circumstances allow such a development . It seems that the experiences we have in life are so unpredictable and so powerful , that they can boost or over-ride other influences , and there seems to be plenty of research findings to confirm this . My own view is that there is no one major influence in a person's life . Instead , the traits we inherit from our parents and the situation and experiences that we encounter in life are constantly interacting . It is the interaction of the two that shapes a person's personality and dictates how that personality develops . If this were not true , we would be able to predict the behavior and character of a person from the moment they were born . In conclusion , I do not think that either nature or nurture is the major influence on a person , but that both have powerful effects", "I strongly support the death penalty for murderers . In today's society , life is very violent . There are many mentally-ill people committing crimes and almost nothing will stop them . We have interviewed captured criminals who say , \"I was going to kill him , but I knew that I could get the death penalty if I did . So I just left him there . \" Obviously , having the death penalty saves lives and that makes a positive difference to society . If a criminal does murder someone , and then gets the death penalty , that isn't society's fault . Everyone knows about the death penalty as a punishment for murder . So , the person who murders is really killing himself at the same time he is killing his victim . The murderer has made the choice to die . It is important to remember that the death penalty is used only for people who have committed very serious crimes . For example , a woman shot a police officer when she was trying to escape from jail . She was already a convicted criminal when she committed murder , and she deserves the death penalty . People need to accept responsibility for their actions", "\"Do as I say , not as I do . \" This is what society tells us when it punishes murderers with the death penalty . Society tells us that murder is wrong , and in our legal system , murder is against the law . Yet we still see our society kill murderers , and thus we are committing murder ourselves . For this reason , the death penalty should end , and instead murderers should be punished with life in prison . Society needs to show a positive model of how our lives should be and how people should act . We should always strive to improve our situation , to be at peace and in harmony with others . However , when we kill murderers , we are not working to improve our society . Instead , we are stooping to the criminals' level . It makes me think about the revenge that came when playing games with my brothers . When we were kids/children , my brother would take my toys , so I would hit him and take my toys back . Then he would hit me harder and take the toys again . Thinking of the death penalty , I imagine a murderer kills someone . Society takes revenge by killing the murderer . This leaves behind the murderer's family and friends , who have tremendous anger inside of them , which they may release onto society . The cycle of killing goes on and on . Society should not condemn people who are taking the same action that society is taking . Society tells us not to kill , and yet society kills when it exercises the death penalty", "Nowadays , purpose of education being changed in Korea . There are some People who think that competition in children should be made , also others believe that children who are taught to co-operate as well as become more usefwl adults . There are advantages and disadvantages for both of the arguments . To begin with , what is good if a sense of competition m children is made? They could develope themselves more and more as they learn and study a lot to win from the competitbn . To prove this , in Korea , it is popular - even common now - to have a tutor who come to student's house to teach extra pieces of study with paying a lot of money . They learn faster than what they learn at school . Furthermore , during the vacations , students study abroad to learn English for a month instead of revise school work . If they have experiments such as study abroad , it is one of the greatest plus point to go to the famous well-known high-school . Moreover , there are four big school exam and two national examinations to test students' level of studies . Generally , only the highest 40% can go to the good quatrty highschools and colleges . Children learn as much as they can , to wim the competition to obtain good quality schools . On the other hand , as they are busy to enter the schools and study individually with their own tutors , there are problems . They become selfish . They become careless and don't help others alot if it is about studies . There will be no co-operations for them . Then , why are there companies for many people to work in? Each of them are clever , however , there are weak parts and strong parts for each person . To co-operate is to improve this part . People talk and listen to what others thmking of and learn . That could also be a great opportunity to learn instead of learning alone with one teacher . In conclusion , I strongly agree with that children should be taught to co-operate rather than compete . Nobody is perfect . People learn together , work together to develop each other", "Families who do not send their children to public school should be required to pay taxes that support public education . Every child in my country is required to attend school and every child is welcome to enroll at his/her local public school . Some families choose to send their children to other schools , and it is their prerogative to do so . However , the public schools are used by the majority of our children and must remain open for everyone . For example , my uncle sent his two children to a private academy for primary school . Then he lost a huge amount of money through some poor investments and he could no longer afford the private school's tuition . The children easily transferred to their local public school and liked it even more than their academy . The public schools supported their family when they had no money to educate their children . Because the public schools educate so many citizens , everyone in my country-whether a parent or not-should pay taxes to support our educational system . We all benefit from the education that students receive in public school . Our future doctors , fire fighters , and teacherspeople whom we rely on everyday-are educated in local public schools . When a person is in trouble , it's reassuring to know that those who will help you-such as fire fighters-know what they're doing because they received good training in school and later . Providing an excellent education in the public school system is vital to the strength of our community and our country . Our government must offer the best education available , but it can only do so with the financial assistance of all its citizens", "Families who do not send their children to government-financed school should not be required to pay taxes that support universal education . When families send their children to non-public (that is , parochial and private) schools , they must pay tuition and other school expenses . Spending additional money to pay taxes creates an even greater financial hardship for these families . They must make sacrifices , trying to have enough money to pay for school in addition to other bills . For example , my friend Amalia is a single mother with an eight-year-old son , Andrew . Because they survive solely on her income , money is tight . Amalia works at least 10 hours of overtime each week to cover Andrew's school expenses . This gives Amalia and Andrew less time to spend together , and she is always so tired that she is impatient with him when they do have family time . Clearly , this extra expense is an unfair burden for hard-working parents like Amalia . While some people may consider parochial or private school to be a luxury , for many families it is essential because their community's public schools fail to meet their children's needs . Unfortunately , due to shrinking budgets , many schools lack well-qualified , experienced educators . Children may be taught by someone who is not a certified teacher or who knows little about the subject matter . Some problems are even more serious . For example , the public high school in my old neighborhood/neighbourhood had serious safety problems , due to students bringing guns , drugs , and alcohol to school . After a gang-related shooting occurred at the high school , my parents felt that they had no choice but to enroll me in a parochial school that was known for being very safe . Unfortunately , even when families prefer public schools , sometimes they can't send their children to one", "When computers first made their way into the business sector , everyone believed that they would make people's jobs easier . What was not expected was that computers would eliminate jobs . Besides contributing to unemployment , these automated workers often exhibit inadequate job performance . A number of jobs have been lost as a direct result of new computer technology . Ticket agents in various transportation facilities , from subway/underground stations to airports are virtually nonexistent these days . Bank tellers have been greatly reduced due to automated bank machines . In addition , many call centers/centres that have help lines are almost entirely computerized/computerised . A few years ago I worked as a helper in our local library . Today this position does not exist , because six new computers have been installed . The number of positions lost to computers grows exponentially , and unemployment continues to get worse . While a computer may easily achieve the main tasks of these jobs , most computers fall short when customers have a unique request or problem . A pre-paid ticket booth does not have insight about the entertainment district and cannot offer friendly directions to a tourist . Similarly , an automated bank machine cannot provide assistance and reassurance to a customer who has just had his credit card stolen . And , more often than not , automated telephone operators cannot answer the one question that we have , and we end up waiting on the line to speak with someone anyway . Every time I go into the library where I worked I notice elderly people who don't know how to use the computers and can't find anyone to help . In the future , I believe a new business trend will evolve . As computers eliminate jobs , new positions will have to be invented . More and more people will go into business for themselves , and hopefully put the personal touch back into business", "These days with increasing urban populations , there are major problems with congestion and not only the price , but also availability of accommodation in large cities of the world . It seems that one possible solution could be to relocate large companies and factories as well as their respective employees out of these urban areas and into more rural ones . In my opinion , I strongly agree that this would have a desired effect in making cities more livable . To begin with , the traffic problem in cities doesn\u2019t only exist from commuting employees , but also the general public travelling around the city . While this may be a fact , if the number of worker\u2019s vehicles is reduced on city streets , a large percentage of traffic will obviously decline in rush hours . For example , peak hour traffic is undoubtedly made up largely of staff from companies going to and from home . Secondly , in regards to housing problems , populations will always continue to grow in cities and therefore inadvertently decrease the number of cheap and available apartments . This is certainly obvious , however , a large proportion of these apartments are occupied by employees from large firms and their families . If this workforce is relocated to housing estates in the country , city apartment blocks will fall in price and certainly increase in availability . In conclusion , by relocating workers to rural areas to work and reside , heavy traffic conditions and lack of adequate accommodation in city centres will obviously change for the better", "I totally disagree with the idea of high-level employees leaving at the age of 55 to make room for the upcoming generation . While it is true that the energy level and fresh ideas of youth can rejuvenate a company , the steady hand of experience can still best guide a company in most cases . In English there is a saying , \u201cYou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks . \u201d In the fast-paced world of business , bolstered by even faster hi-tech innovations , a younger more pliant mind would seem to be able to adapt with greater flexibility , while such an environment might boggle an older more set-in-its-ways mind . Take , for example , Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates , whose energy and brilliant insights as a youth helped him to pioneer new territory in the computer software world and establish a digital empire . Now as a more mature CEO , this king of the \u201ccomputer\u201d mountain is constantly on the verge of being knocked down by upcoming digeratti entrepreneurs . However , it is now the experience he has accumulated as an older man which keeps him on top . So , combining the vigour and innovation of younger workers with the experience of older workers would seem to be the winning hand in the world of business . The assertion is to give opportunities to the younger generation . If everyone retires at 55 , there will be smaller pool of experience at the company . So , who will show them the ropes of the trade? It would be as if we lopped off the last few chapters of a textbook . On this point the argument would seem to be built on false presumptions . And think of all the other problems retirement at 55 would create . With life expectancy in many advanced nations at 70-plus years , how would the state along with private enterprises be able to support their retirement pensions? The economic repercussions of such an idea could be great . Besides , the Western form of capitalism is built on competition and merit and not seniority according to age , and democracy is built on equality for all regardless of one\u2019s age , so the argument clearly goes against these two pillars of Western society . Granted , my counter-arguments are perhaps as simplistic as the original assertion itself , but without qualifying the assertion with greater supporting evidence or background information , both sides can be argued . Nevertheless , even after thoroughly considering the argument , I believe I would still adhere to my viewpoint that the assertion lacks merit for the aforementioned reasons . Besides , when I am 55 I do not fancy the idea of being put out to pasture", "What would the world be like without Shakespeare or the Olympics? While medical care and education are perhaps the highest causes to which money can be contributed , the arts and athletics are in some ways just as valuable . So , to ask the government to not extend support to these two areas could be just as detrimental to the welfare of society as the lack of sufficient health care and education . The Romans believed in \u201cmens sana in corpore sano\u201d . In short , that there is indeed a correlation between a healthy body and healthy mind . When we are healthy , we feel better and so are more likely to be productive academically . Plus , the practice of sports can also teach us the very same discipline we need for our studies . Why even a brisk walk or watching an exciting athletic match can refresh the mind for greater work . Moreover , sports can serve to create healthier bodies , which in turn would serve as a form of \u201cpreventive medicine\u201d thereby cutting down on medical costs . In the same vein , the arts are known to induce a sense of well-being in performers and audience alike , reducing mental problems and their associated physical manifestations and again , medical costs . As such , building theatres and stadiums , which spur interest in the arts and sports respectively , actually would be practically identical to spending money on medical care and education! Now I realize the question specifically addresses the building of theatres and sports stadiums by government . Some people would contend athletics and the arts can still be enjoyed and practiced without such constructions . I would hazard that these buildings stand as the altars to the sports and arts worlds , inspiring would-be athletes and performers . Without such venues where would sports spectators and music aficionados be able to enjoy these events? Now some other people would also say business could support their construction , but we know the avarice of business could very likely jeopardize the lofty spirit of athletics and the arts just as well . Therefore , allowing government to retain some say in the matter on behalf of the people would , I believe , be in the best interest of the people . In short , as long as the government does no go overboard in its expenditures for these buildings and uses such venues for the benefit of all , then , as mentioned above , people will benefit in terms of both medical care and education as well", "With the advent of globalization , a common language to facilitate trade and communication seems inevitable . Some oppose the development of a single language on the grounds that it may lead to cultural erosion and a loss of local linguistic knowledge . Yet , I am of the opinion that it is possible to use an official international language and still retain one\u2019s own language and culture . Firstly , many countries already use an official language or languages . For example , in India there are two official languages: Hindi and English . In a country such as India where there are innumerable languages spoken , there is a need for official languages to ensure communication between different sections of the population and the different states . In China , where different dialects are spoken , Mandarin , the official language , enables people from different provinces to comprehend each other . Secondly , in an age of rampant globalization there is no doubt that an international language is inevitability . How is an African businessman going to conduct business in China when there are such differences between languages? In this sense , not only is an international language inevitable , but also a necessity for trade , commerce and economic expansion in the 21st century . The critics opposing the adoption of an international official language argue that it would lead to a loss of cultural identity . However , the use of an international official language doesn\u2019t mean that local languages will die out . For example , English already functions as a kind of unofficial international language but this doesn\u2019t mean that people solely converse in English or they neglect their own language . English is used in specific contexts (trade , business , etc) and native languages are used for everyday instruction . In brief , as the world becomes smaller the need for an official international language seems unavoidable . English has already assumed this role although its status is unofficial", "It\u2019s widely believed in today\u2019s materialistic world that the latest innovative fashion trends hold great significance . On the other hand , such trends are believed to be set only in the pursuit of profits for large designer companies . It seems that in recent times , people are now changing their minds in regards to wearing clothes for comfort and as a personal choice . Personally I agree that we should pay more attention to individuality and comfort in the way we dress . Firstly , fashion designs exist as a form of creative artistic expression of the designer . Although this may be true , undoubtedly such designs take away individuality once a trend is set in place . By this I mean that there is nothing unique about wearing what everybody else does . More specifically , if everyone sports the latest colour and design in summer skirts , do we not look the same? Secondly , It is possible that fashion trends can look extremely stylish to the general public . However , it can be argued that the main purpose of wearing clothes is for more functional reasons . This is primarily due to the fact that clothes were traditionally worn to protect people from climatic conditions . For instance , clothes are still worn basically to keep people warm and dry in winter and cool in summer . Finally , fashion certainly gives us a sense of confidence and pride in our appearance . While this is certainly a good point , it also means that following such changeable trends proves to be expensive . For example , purchasing every latest season\u2019s fashion item will of course blow the budget of many young people", "One of the greatest advantages is that the children learn to be independent . Having to cook , clean , and pay bills instills this in them . Often they have to work part-time to make ends meet , and this impresses upon them the importance of work and money management . Another important factor is that these children will be exposed to different cultures and ways of thinking . They will become more open-minded and tolerant and are likely to become more adaptable individuals . One of the main motives for sending young people abroad to study is that it enhances their employment prospects . In my experience of living in foreign countries and speaking to various youths , it seems that a foreign education is regarded as something desirable and helpful in getting a decent job . A degree from Britain , for example , is seen as being of a higher standard than one from a developing country . Furthermore , living in a foreign country may lead to fluency in a second language , which is another selling point for prospective employers . In addition , many companies are keen to recruit people with a global outlook . There are a few drawbacks however . For instance , without parental supervision , the new found freedom children experience may lead to harmful practices such as drug-taking and drinking . Reluctance or inability to reintegrate into their mother country is another . To sum up , it can be seen that the advantages of studying abroad for children are more numerous than the disadvantages", "The growth of tourism and the numbers of people travelling to other countries for their vacations has led to debate as to whether this is beneficial . I believe that there are many problems which arise out of the tourist industry , and will examine these in detail . Many people argue that travel broadens the mind . However , this statement does not fully hold water . I would argue that spending a few weeks in another country is not long enough to gain a proper understanding of an alien culture . A foreigner visiting Britain might be met with the traditional British reserve , and mistakenly conclude that the British are unfriendly . Furthermore , some people are unwilling to open their minds . A Western traveller to an Arab country is unlikely to consider that the veiling of women is acceptable . Being a tourist in a foreign country brings with it problems that can lead to dislike of the native people . Firstly , a foreigner is vulnerable , and is often ripped off by locals . Secondly , the language barrier can lead to misunderstandings . Thirdly , tourists are often hassled to buy goods , which can ruin a holiday . When I went to Bali , people tried to sell me something every five minutes , and this totally spoilt my sunbathing . Local people also often end up disliking foreigners . Visitors may mistakenly act contrary to local norms , or they may just be plain offensive , as many drunken British holidaymakers must seem to the Spanish . Global tourism can lead to hostility from the native people , who may feel their traditional way of life is under threat . Additionally , the relative wealth of the foreign visitors can cause envy and resentment", "In the modern workplace there is no longer the attitude that \u2018a job is for life\u2019 . Nowadays , many people take the option to change jobs , while others prefer not to . In my essay , I will explore the good and bad points of the above attitudes . One of the main benefits of staying in one job is security . Changing employer often means a period of instability , where one may have to think about moving house , or temporarily losing a steady source of income . Staying in one job means these problems are avoided . Another benefit of not changing occupation is that one is able to gain a lot of experience and expertise in his specific profession , thus enhancing job security . One\u2019s company may recognize their loyalty and reward their service . On the other hand , those who often change jobs may be seen as unreliable , lacking in experience and employers might be reluctant to hire and invest training in them . However , there are arguments in favour of changing job frequently . One is that a worker improves his employability . Working in several different jobs often means that the individual has more skills . Such people are seen as more dynamic and versatile . Another benefit of changing jobs frequently is that one never gets stuck in a rut . From my own experience , I got bored when I spent too long in a job . Following this , the quality of my work would suffer . I also believe that employers generally don\u2019t tend to greatly reward loyalty or commitment . Increased wages and promotion are often easier to attain by changing jobs . Overall , it can be said that the disadvantages of changing jobs are the advantages of staying put , and vice versa", "In the past , a majority of academics have held the opinion that universities should only offer a theoretically-based approach to teaching throughout their courses , as opposed to the more recent trend towards empirical acquisition of knowledge involving more \u201chands on\u201d experience . Is this the most effective way for students to learn vital academic information while undertaking their degrees? Undoubtedly , advantages and disadvantages of both academic learning styles have to be evaluated . Firstly , on the one hand , despite being the more traditional educational approach , learning from theory in relevant academic discourses to identify established knowledge allows us to gain a professional insight . For example , students can easily identify facts and opinions from past discourses . In addition , students acquire knowledge more easily when given relative theoretical examples to build upon . For instance , in subjects such as history or sociology , studying textbook examples allows students to unravel complex academic theories which they could expand on . Alternatively , there are some disadvantages for students . On the other hand , there is no doubt that students could find themselves reading tedious and monotonous academic papers . For instance , university degrees involving the evaluation of numerous \u2018long-winded\u2019 academic discourses provide little inspiration for students , discouraging enthusiasm . Obviously , interest can be stimulated through empirical research in class . By this I mean that \u2018the human brain learns best by doing\u2019 . Although time-consuming , there is no substitute for learning from making mistakes . In conclusion , while both approaches have benefits and drawbacks in our ever-changing academic world , I honestly believe that a more practical approach promotes a stronger acquisition of academic knowledge", "A much debated issue these days is whether citizens should take out private health insurance or not . The cost of providing free medical care for both the wealthy and the poor is far too great for any government , and most people agree that if you can pay for insurance , you should . In this essay , I will argue that all who can afford it should be insured , but free medical care must be made available for those too poor to do so . The most important reason for encouraging people to take out private health insurance is the cost to the government of health care . Free health cover for people who are able to pay for it is a waste of public money . Of course , people will only pay health insurance premiums if they know that they are getting good value for their money . If they get sick , they should pay very little or nothing at all . In addition , the privately insured are entitled to special benefits such as having the choice of their own doctors , and being able to avoid long waiting lists for hospital beds . On the other hand , those who really cannot afford to pay private insurance premiums , which are often very high , are still entitled as citizens to the best medical care available \u2013 they cannot be expected to pay their own medical bills . However , if they are working , they should still pay a percentage of their wage (say 1 to 2%) as a tax which pays towards the cost of providing \"free\" medical services . In conclusion , most people should privately insure their health , but it is unreasonable to suppose that all citizens can afford it", "People learn through their entire lives . They constantly improve their knowledge and develop . I think that a college or university education should be available to all students because every person has the right to choose the way to self-perfection . Bellow I will give some of my reasons to support my position . First of all , every person should have the chance to get a higher degree , gain new knowledge and experience . However , some people believe that higher education should be available only to good students . I think it is silly . It is like to make unavailable traveling for one who does not have IQ high enough . Second of all , some young people do not do well at school but they have great personality and ability to learn . They are self-confident , persistent and patient . With these qualities they can get higher grades then their classmates who are talented but lazy . Imagine for example situation when a teenager gets high grades because his or her parents constantly make him or her study and help to do most of the homework . In this case a child does very well at school but I think a college can show the opposite results . Finally , it is a discrimination against students to make available higher education only for good ones . So , if a student does poor and gets low grades he/she should be sent down . But if a person was never given a chance to try himself/herself at college , what to do in this case? To sum up , I think that all young people should have the chance to get a higher education", "Man , through the ages , has undergone any changes from the time when he had to haunt for food to these days when he has to buy it . Some people prefer to buy fresh vegetables , meat and fruits and prepare food at home . However , other people prefer to skip that step with cooking and have dinner at a restaurant . I think that both of these choices have some advantages and disadvantages . Bellow I will give some reasons to support my answer . Personally , I do not like fast food . So , my choice is always between a restaurant and my home . First of all , I would like to say that cooking is a great tradition . It helps people to relax , reflect on some pleasant moments while peeling or cutting the vegetables . It is a means of eliminating one's stress and tension . Second of all , sometimes I do not want to have something too complicated for my dinner . I just want to have light food like a salad and a glass of milk . So , one of the reasons why I like to eat at home is because I can have what I want at this moment . One greater thing about eating at home is that I can sit in front of the TV and watch an interesting program or a movie . Finally , having dinner at home allows a family communicates with each other , be closer and share some good and bad moments that happened earlier that day . Besides , eating at home is a great way to save some money . As for restaurants , I see some positive aspects about eating there too . First of all , I sometimes get tired from peeling , cutting , washing , frying , etc . It does not mean I do it a lot . Sometimes I just use the microwave and a preprocessed food that I bought earlier . I want to have something more delicious than I have in my refrigerator , something that is time-consuming to prepare at home . So , for me it is a good reason to go to a restaurant . There one may meet old friends or just has a great time listening to music and tasting some delicious meats . Also , restaurants are a good place to celebrate something . One does not have to prepare food for all friends who are coming , wash dish , put in order all that mess after the party , etc . In conclusion , I think that it does not important where one has one's dinner", "I am from Russia . From my opinion the most beneficial discovery for people in our country has been the discovery of the outer space . Russia is the first country that launched a spacecraft with a man on the board into the space . This event was a big step towards the new discoveries and brought many benefits not only for people in my country . Bellow I will give my reasons to support my answer . First of all , all humankind made a huge step towards the mystery of our creation . Scientists had the opportunity to do the new research and experiments . Many new discoveries were made on the boards of the spacecrafts in the outer space . People from all over the world watched these events . Many books with real colorful photos were written about the beginning of the space exploration . Nowadays we have a big station called \"Mir\" in the outer space created on the base of collaboration USA and Russia . Many people work there doing amazing experiments . Second of all , the world became \"smaller\" . People learnt how to exchange information very quickly by use of satellites . Television is broad-casted all over the world by use of satellites . Here in Houston I can watch Russian programs . People got the opportunity to exchange news very quickly", "From my everyday experience and observation I can claim that discussion of an important decision with other people bring many benefits . In the following paragraphs I will give my reasons to defend this statement . First of all , different people have different opinions . In order to make the right choice people should discuss every possible decision and its consequences . Making an important decision alone can bring many negative aspects . For instance , a person can reveal his selfishness or impatience and the consequences of that decision can affect many people in the future . I think that a good and wise decision can be born only in discussion because people can share their knowledge and experiences a look at the problem from different sides and aspects . Second of all , I think that making decision alone is unacceptable especially for a company . Imagine that a chief makes the decision about increasing a production line without discussing it with his employees . In this case a part of company's profit will be spending on extended purchase of raw materials . So , share holders will be left without dividends . This decision may lead to getting rid of company's shares and as a result of this declining the value of a company as a whole", "In our modern stressful world we often forget about our customs and traditions . However , I think that people should keep their traditions because they help to remember our forefathers and value the beautiful moments we have in our lives . In my country we have a great custom called \"Maslenica\" . It is a holiday , which is celebrated at the end of the winter . Many people gather on the biggest square of the city and see of the winter . They say to the winter good-bye and ask the spring to change the winter . They celebrate the beginning of the life when everything starts to grow . People at this holiday bake pancakes and treat each other with them . Also , many people gathered on the square play different games . For example , the most well-known game \"pulling a rope\" subsists in that two teams pull a rope . The winner is the team , witch has a longer rope . Other people draw on the icy pole . People have fun at this holiday even if they just observe those games and do not participate . In conclusion , I am sure that \"Maslenica\" would benefit many countries all over the world . People have the opportunity to relax , leave their troubles and worries behind and have fun . Also , this holiday helps people to find out more about each other , communicate and meet new people", "People may choose to keep their old traditions from their native country or to accept new ones . Keeping the old customs will help one to overcome the cultural shock and the change of the environment . From the other side , accepting the new traditions will help one to adapt and make new friends with residents . In this essay I will give different reasons why people decide to follow the customs of the new country or to keep their own customs . If one is from the country with strong and old traditions , I think it will be rather difficult for him to adapt to the new customs and moreover to reject his own . That is why some people from the same country try to live together and to create their own community where the old traditions are kept . They can not break the customs that were created by their ancestors . For example , some nations are restricted in certain kinds of food by their traditions . So , they do not go to the restaurants unless their traditional food is served there . Some nations according to their customs have to wear certain types of cloth because their religion tells them to do so . From the other side , if one is from the country with traditions similar to ones of the new country it will be easy for him to adopt and to follow the customs of the new place . He will not feel much difference . Probably , the most difficult part of his relocation will be to accustom to the new climate . I think that people of the new country are friendlier when they see that foreigner follows their customs . I belief that traditions of every country deserve respect , especially , when one lives there", "Man , through the ages , has undergone many changes from the time when he depicted a herd of mammoths on the walls of the cave to these days when he can chart with someone on the other side of the globe . Modern technology is rapidly changing the world's living standards that results in creating a single world culture . New technologies including Internet , television , electronic media , means of transportation , etc has a great impact on creating a similar culture all around the globe . Bellow I will list my reasons to support my opinion . First of all , Internet and e-mail have changed the way people communicate to each other . Internet brought many benefits . It is a new means of communication , a fast access to information and news . People communicate with each other , share their ideas , happiness and difficulties . We have a great opportunity to find out more about countries and their history . Second of all , the modern means of transportation allows people to move from one place to another very quickly . A few centuries ago it was impossible to imagine waking up in one country and falling asleep in another . Finally , as a result of all mentioned above the boundaries between countries , their traditions and customs are erased . Many people migrate during their lives . Some of them are looking for a better place to live , others want to get new experience and knowledge or just pleasure . So , many families are created between people from different countries . Traditions fuse and evolve into other ones or just vanish . To sup up , modern technology has a great impact on the way people live now", "Traveling is a good way to find out more about different countries with different traditions and customs . Some travelers prefer to spend in one country just a few days or one day and then leave for another country . This way of traveling allows people to visit more countries in fewer days . Unfortunately , in this case such travelers have to hurry in order to visit more places . I am from Saint-Petersburg , Russia . So , if a foreign visitor has only one day to spend in my country I think I would advice him to visit the \"Hermitage\" - the most well known and amazing museum in Russia . The \"Hermitage\" has 3 floors and more then 100 halls . It is really amazing to visit that place . Many people from all over the world every day enter its walls . Some of the rooms devoted to the history of other countries . Others devoted to the art of a famous painter and the history of his life . However , most of the halls conclude many things such as paintings , royal belongings , sculptures from Russian history . Some people say that it is impossible to feel deeply and see all these amazing historical values for one visit . I have to completely agree with this statement . When I first visited the \"Hermitage\" I was 14 years old . It impressed me so much that I was back next day to see what I had not been able to see the day before . The \"Hermitage\" is an impressive and beautiful museum", "I am a person who likes to travel . I think traveling is a great opportunity to meet new people , gain more knowledge and experience , and learn new customs and traditions . I did not travel a lot yet , but I am sure I will have a chance to do it . So , if I had the opportunity to visit a foreign country I would visit Egypt . I think it is a great and very interesting country with marvellous history . In the following paragraphs I will give some reasons to support my choice . First of all , I always dreamed to visit Egypt pyramids . My aunt visited Egypt a few years ago . She was very excited after that trip and said that she would return there one more time at any cost . She said that Egypt had impressed her very much with its glorious pyramids and ancient buildings . Second of all , I think that in that country one can touch history , feel the hard breath of workers building a pyramid under the parching sun , and see the chain of camels walking in the desert with the huge trunks full of presents for Cleopatra on their humps . Finally , I want to see a real dessert and ride the camel . All my friends who rode the camel say that it is an unforgettable experience . I believe that I will have a chance to visit this beautiful country someday . Unfortunately , now I have plenty of plans and things to do , so , I am afraid that I will not be able to travel for the next two years . I want to finish my education and then find a job , and these things have higher priority then traveling . My husband wants to visit this country too and we made an agreement to make our trip to Egypt on our five years anniversary which is in two years . In conclusion , I want to add that after my trip to Egypt I will definitely visit Australia", "From my everyday experience and observation I think that artists as well as scientists bring many benefits to society . It is a controversial question weather the contributions of artists are more or less then the contributions of scientists to the society . For several reasons , which I will mention bellow , I think that both types are valuable , priceless and irreplaceable for every society . The contributions of artists to the society are very essential . Art can form person\u2019s spiritual sense , their views and personalities . People learn history , the traditions of their country trough the art . We also watch movies that entertain and at the same time extend our range of interests . Another important aspect of this is that art is an ancient means of communication . In old times people depicted the herds of mammoths on the walls of their caves . They performed different rituals around the fireplace asking their gods for health , good harvest and weather . Our language is a result of people's need to communicate . From the other side , the contribution of scientists is could not be exaggerated . All humankind is indebted to the scientists because of their work and achievements . Scientists make our life easier . We have cars and airplanes to move fast from one place to another . We have microwaves and a bunch of preprocessed food to make the cooking much easier . We have different devices that simplify all we do . Finally , scientists are making great achievements in medicine that make our life longer and happier . Nowadays people have a great opportunity to do many things faster by use of computers . To sup up , I believe that artists nourish our souls when scientists and technology feed our minds", "Some people say that the invention of computers is one of the greatest humankind's inventions . However , other people think that computers make their life more stressful . I agree with those people who think that computers brought many benefits and play a very important role in our modern life . First of all , every company nowadays uses a computer to store its data and make different kinds of operations . It is very difficult to imagine life without computers . A company would have to store millions of papers and documents . Moreover , a customer would have to wait hours to check his balance or get a piece of information about his transactions at his bank , while an employee was looking trough those papers . Another important aspect of this is that people are able to type all their information , make corrections , print or send documents using computers . It makes life much easier . One can spend the rest of the time watching TV with his family or working on something new . We use computers every day sometimes even not knowing it . When we go to a store and use our credit cards many computers process our information and perform transactions . When we need to get some cash we use money access machines that are computerized too . Second of all , computers provided a great means of communication - the Internet . I think it is the easiest and cheapest way to get in touch with relatives , friends , business colleagues , etc . Nowadays the world becomes smaller and smaller . When I was a little girl , I could not imagine that it would be possible to communicate with people from all around the world in so easy way . A person can get latest news , become friends with someone from another country , find his old friends , ask for a piece of advice , etc . Finally , in addition to these practical benefits people can shop without leaving their house . They just use an Internet access , a computer and their cards to make a payment . It is kind of difficult to imagine that a few years ago people had to spend their time in lines buying tickets . Now , a person can choose a destination , company , date and time and get tickets delivered to his door . I think it is amazing . To sum up , I believe that computers made our lives easier . They change our attitude towards life", "It is rather difficult for me to answer the question how I prefer to complain: in writing or in person because sometimes I just do not have a choice . For example , if I order a product using the Internet from another state or even country , I will more likely have the opportunity to speak to a representative of a company in person . So , in some cases I choose to speak in person and in others I prefer to complain in writing . However , I believe that every option has its advantages . From the one side , complaining in writing brings many benefits . First of all , one does not have to spend his precious time driving , waiting for his turn and talking with a representative . He can just send mail or e-mail and get all explanation he needs . Second of all , I think it is the best way to avoid an unpleasant conversation . Personally , I do not like to complain about anything especially , in person . Finally , sometimes it is impossible to have a face-to-face conversation because a company which provided a poor product or service is too far away . From the other side , complaining in person has some benefits too . First , this type of complaining provides an immediate feedback . So , if I have some complains about company's products I will receive all information and explanation right away . However , sending a company a letter and getting a feedback can take more then a month . Second , face-to-face conversation is often more effective . People talk to each other , see each other facial gestures and body movements , which can tell a lot about a person . In addition to these practical benefits , in the case if one can not receive creditable explanation from one representative he always can require to talk to another person . For instance , my husband recently had some extra withdraws from his account by his bank and he was not aware of it . So , he went to the bank and explained to the bank's representative the situation and they together found the solution and that money was given back to my husband's account . I think , in this case face-to-face conversation is the best way to complain and get feedback fast . In conclusion , I think that if I have to complain about a product or poor service I will do it in person", "The issue whether working for a large company is better than working for a small company is a controversial one . From my everyday experience and observation I think that every option has its advantages and disadvantages . I base my opinion on the following points . From the one side working for a large company brings many benefits . First of all , one has better medical insurance , higher salary . Often employees of a large company have less responsibility . Moreover , they feel more secure because their company has more clients and this means better chance to survive on the modern market . However , one working for a large company has less chance to be promoted because one's manager does not want to lose his or her job unless she or he is promoted too . Also , from my observation , managers of a large company do not pay much attention to one's solutions and suggestions . From the other side working for a small company has many advantages too . Firstly , one has better chance to be promoted . Secondly , one can talk to the owner of the company about any improvements that can be done in order to get more profit . Another important aspect of working for a small company is the opportunities to find out more about how company works . As a result of this one can gain more experience and get better recommendations . However , this also has some disadvantages . For instance , one can get less salary , worse medical benefits , etc . To sum up , I think that every person chooses for himself what he or she wants . If one wants better career and more responsibilities then a small company is better choice", "I think the question what would I do if I had a chance to improve my community is difficult . I have in my mind many things , the improvement of which will make our community better place to live but they all require the participation of many people and , moreover , they require investments , which I can not provide . For example , my community is quite noisy . We have the huge mall just in front of our community , so traffic jams are very common for this place . I think that the construction of a few pass-by roads will benefit all people who live here as well as people who drive by every day . Unfortunately , the question is what I can do for my community giving a few hours of my time every month . I think I can not do much , but I still can help someone in my community . For example , I can baby-sit . I know a couple of families with little children , who can not afford to spend much money on the baby-sitter . One of these families is a single mom with a little girl . Julia , this is her name , is a waitress in a restaurant . She is a great person and we became close friends . So , sometimes I offer her help with her child when she has to work in the evenings . Another family has two funny little twins . One time their parents asked me to babysit their children because they had to attend an unexpected presentation . I think this kind of help brings many benefits to my community . First of all , people become friendlier . For example , those families , which I mentioned above , became friends after I introduced them to each other . Second of all , people get to know each other and feel more secure in their houses and apartments . Finally , I am ready to help those people because I am sure that they will help me too . One time I lost the keys from my car and Julia offered me her car for a while", "The invention of television is undoubtedly one of humankind's greatest inventions . It is a way of communication among people of one country and different countries and nations . People watch TV to find out about the latest news , weather , sports , etc . It is a great way to learn new and extend one's range of interests . Scientists say that children spend the same amount of hours in front of TV as they do in school . I think that this can be said about many grown people too . Also , television is a great means of eliminating stress and tension . One can relax and leave one's troubles behind lying on one's favorite sofa and watching a comedy . However , some people believe that television has destroyed communication among friends and family . Personally , I do not agree with this statement . A couple centuries ago people spent their time gambling , reading , gossiping or playing chess . I do not think that television is a cause of destroyed communication among family members and friends . First of all , if members of a family have common interests and they want to make each other happy they will always find many ways to spend their time together and be close . Otherwise , if people avoid each other and they do not have anything to share with each other they will find television a great way to escape from this miserable existence . I believe that many people chose family and their friends over some soap operas or a movie . Second of all , I think that television can be a great resource of subjects to discuss . Many people watch different educational programs to find out more about their environment , nature , wild life animals , economic situations , etc . So , when they gather with their friends they discuss important issues and arque with each other in looking for the truth . My husband and I often watch the news channel to keep abreast of the latest news . After that we always discuss some issues we concerned about . Also , we like to watch a TV show \"the funniest animals\" . We like this program because it makes us laugh . I can not imagine how these programs can prevent our communication and be harmful to our relations . To summarize , I would like to add that if people want to communicate with each other they will find a way to do it", "A large number of people spend most of their time at work . Our life is divided into three equal parts: 8 hours - sleep , 8 hours - work , 8 hours - family time . So , in the most cases , one's co-worker plays an important role in one's life . From my opinion , the essential characteristics of a co-worker are the following . First of all , a person who works closely with me must like his job . I think it is very important for a person to feel satisfaction with his job . My husband is a software developer . He is fond of his job and people enjoy working with him because they see how many energy he puts into his job . Second of all , my co-worker must be persistent and never give up . I like when people who came across a problem try to solve it , find a good decision instead of looking for another person to hand it over . Another important aspect of this is that a good worker should always ask himself \"What can be improved?\" and suggests new solutions . In addition , he must be a good team player . In the modern world good communication skills and the ability to work in a team are among the common position requirements . Personally , I think it is great to help each other , share new ideas , develop new solutions , etc . It helps to create a team spirit and improve labor productivity . Finally , my co-worker must be punctual . He or she should finish the job on time I think that It is unacceptable to make the rest of a team wait while a person finishes his or her job . Also , my \"ideal co-worker\" should always be ready to offer his or her help and be supportive", "I can not completely agree with the statement that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school . In this essay I will first focus on the reasons why I agree with this statement and then list a few points why from my opinion in some cases is not true . From the one side , classmates have a significant influence on child's behavior and his or her success in school . First of all , children spend much time at school . Classmates have many things in common such as age , interests , homework and classes after all . So , they discuss their impressions about a new teacher , solve problems together , learn their homework , gain new knowledge and experience and even make their own discoveries . Sharing all these makes them closer . Some of them become friends and they spend after-school time together . In addition friends tend to copy each other's habits and manners . For instance , my little sister became friends with the girl who did not have good grades at school at that time . It does not mean she could not have better grades; she just had many friends who did not care about their grades . So , when they started to spend their time together and share their interests , girl's grades improved . They did their homework together , shared their dreams and exciting moments . From this point I must agree that classmates can change child\u2019s attitude towards school . From the other side , parents have a great influence on children' success in school too . For example if parents show an interest in their child's progress and talk to him or her about the importance of learning I think their child will listen to them and do his or her best . Personally , I believe that relationships between parents and a child play an essential role in child's success in school", "Some people believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city . However , other people think that a big city gives more opportunities and it is good for the long run . Personally , for several reasons I think that it is better for children's health to grow up in the country . First of all , it is very important for a child to grow up in a healthy environment . Children need fresh air , not polluted by the huge amount of cars and factories of the modern city . In the country they can spend more time exercising and walking with their friends . Scientists say that now children spend the same amount of time watching TV as they do at school . Probably , the possibility to join their friends for a play will change this proportion . Another important aspect of this is that parents will have more time to spend with their children as a result of eliminating traffic jams and decreasing driving time as a whole . From the other side , children have some advantages living in a big city . For example , they have more opportunities to choose from what they want to do . They can choose to attend ballet school , school of art , gymnastics , etc . For the long run , it is good for them . They will be better prepared for a live in a \"real world\" and they will have more chances to make a good career and succeed . Moreover , a big city usually has many entertaining centers with movie theatres and play stations . When I was a child I liked to go to the movie theatre with my parents to watch a premiere . One more reason to choose a big city for a child is that a city provides better live conditions and services such as medical , dental , etc . My friend lived in the country for a while and one time he and his family had to drive a couple of hours to the nearest medical center when his child got a heavy cough . To summarize , I agree with those people who want to raise their children in a city . The plenty of opportunities offered by a city helps children to find what they really like and be the best at it", "I am from Saint-Petersburg , Russia . It is a very beautiful city that attracts many people every year . My close friend is going to move here after her graduation . She already found a job and she asked me to help her with an apartment . Knowing her very well I think I can enumerate the majority of things she will like and dislike about my city . First of all , I believe she will like a huge amount of museums , theatres , movie theatres , etc . My friend is from a small town , so , she can not enjoy all these benefits at her native town . Second of all , it seems to me that she will like the way people live here . The pace of life is much faster here then in a small town . People are always in a hurry , they try to catch a bus , and then they run to the nearest subway station , go to an office , meet new people , etc . Also , I think my friend will like people here . They are very friendly and ready to offer a help to those in need . Unfortunately , my friend will not surely like some things . As a result of a huge amount of cars and factories the air is polluted here . One more thing she will definitely not like is the weather . It is quite humid here . However , I think she will also like the public transport here . The bus services are run by the Government and it is quite regular . If one in a hurry he can take a taxi , which also is quite cheap and provide a good transport", "People learn through their entire lives . Curiosity was always the basic characteristic of a human being . We always want to break limits and learn more . At this point some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and spend most of their time on school studies . This will help them to succeed in the future . However , for several reasons , which I will explain bellow , I think that children should not study at a very early age . Of cause , children who begin to study at a very early age have more chances to succeed in the future . They gain more knowledge and experience which are priceless and valuable . In addition , studying more now they will give them the opportunity to perfect their knowledge in the future and become better professionals . However , I think that every child must have his or her childhood . Children should learn through playing and communication with their friends and parents . I think that such basic qualities as kindness , self-confidence and just a good sense of humor can not be gained from studying . Children should more time spend with their family , playing and learning with their parents . Imagine that a child instead of playing with his friends does his homework and feel exhausted and tired . Another important aspect of this is that children at their early ages need more exercise because at this age the development of their body is a very essential aspect . Children first of all must be healthy . To sum up , I think that children should have their careless childhood with no responsibilities", "Some parents believe that watching television is bad for their children . So , they try to restrict their children from watching TV . However , other parents think that there is nothing bad in watching TV . Personally , I think that watching TV brings children only benefits unless they spend in front of TV set less then a couple of hours daily . For the following reasons , which I will mention bellow , I believe that television plays an essential role in child's development . First of all , television helps a child to extent his or her range of interests . Children can find out many new things and make many exiting discoveries for themselves . In addition to these practical benefits television improves children's vocabulary , their memory and gives them the opportunity to gain more knowledge . I think it is very essential for a child . Of cause , someone can say that there are plenty of different recourses of information such as books and teachers . But , I think , in our modern world children must learn faster and use all contemporary technology in order to succeed . Second of all , watching cognitive programs helps children to learn more about wild life , our environment and about the importance of preserving our forest and wild animals that live there . Scientists say that a child should not watch TV more then 40 minutes successively . For example , my mother always made us have a break after watching TV more then half an hour and let our eyes rest for several minutes before turning on the TV again . I think it is the best solution . To sum up , I believe that television gives children and all people the opportunity to learn what can not be learn from books . Television and movies in particular allow people to feel the reality and see what they will most likely not be able to see in their lives . Personally , when I was a child I liked to watch cognitive programs about wild animals . Unfortunately , my family had only one TV , but these programs were the only ones we all wanted to watch", "Language is the best means of communication . In the modern globalization era it is not enough to be able to speak one language to communicate with the outside world . I strongly support the idea that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school . They faster become familiar with a strange language , improve their hearing ability to understand new words as time goes by and learn new words . In the following paragraphs I will list some reasons to support my position . First of all , if one wants to see outcome soon , one must start sooner . So , the early children begin to learn new language the better will be the result . Scientists say that a child does not confuse two different languages but learns them more effectively . Second of all , adults are often afraid to make mistakes when they are speaking in a new language . This fear is one of the biggest barriers for a person in his efforts to speak freely . Otherwise , children do not afraid of making grammatical mistakes because basically they just repeat words and sentences in the way they hear them . Also , children have a better chance to get rid of an accent . They faster get used to the right pronunciation and better feel the melody of a language . To sum up , I think that it is very essential for children to begin learning a foreign language in their early ages . It is brings many benefits such as great pronunciation", "Parents are in most cases our first teachers and friends . From my everyday experience I have to agree with the statement that important decisions should be made by our parents or adult relatives . In the following paragraphs I will give my reasons to support this statement . First of all , teenage children have the tendency to live in their own fantasies . They do not clearly understand the rules of a real life . When I was 18 years old I thought that the world was perfect and everything seemed to be simple . Teenagers are basically inexperienced; they aspire for independence and try to make their first steps towards freedom . I think that it is like starting to walk when a baby needs its parents for support . An independent life is a big and significant part in a person's life . So , my point is that it is very important to make this step right . Second of all , I think that parents have right to interfere in their children's lives . They need to know what kind of friends their children have and how children spend their spare time . For example I had an eighteen years old friend who got really angry with his parents when they prohibited him to be friends with a young man . Somehow his parents found out that that young man was occasionally taking drugs . That man was dead in a year because of drug abuse . After that accident my friend thanked his parents for that interference . Finally , I think teenage children should be more open-minded with their parents . It will help them to make the right choice and avoid many mistakes", "Some people believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city . However , other people think that a big city gives more opportunities and it is good for the long run . Personally , for several reasons I think that it is better for children's health to grow up in the country . First of all , it is very important for a child to grow up in a healthy environment .

To summarize , I agree with those people who want to raise their children in a city . The plenty of opportunities offered by a city helps children to find what they really like and be the best at it", "The issue about whether children should help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so is open for debate . Some people say that children should devote more time for playing with their friends , watching TV and studying . However , other people believe that children should help their parents with household tasks . Personally , for several reasons , which I will explain bellow , I adhere to the latter point of view . First of all , I think that every child should have his or her own responsibilities . When I was a child my parents taught me how to make breakfast in the morning . So , I woke up , went to the kitchen and prepared a couple of toasts for breakfast . It was easy and I enjoyed doing it because I liked the way my parents thanked me and I felt that they were proud of me . Also , my mom always wanted me to know how to cook , clean and iron my cloth . Thanks to the learning , nowadays , when my maid can not come to my house I handle all household tasks myself . Second of all , performing household tasks teaches children to value the job of people who did it . When I was a child I did not imagine that cleaning house could be so time and energy consuming . So , when I began to do some of the household tasks by myself I began to respect the job of others and tryed to collect all my toys after my playing with them . Finally , doing household tasks teaches children to arrange their time . In addition to those practical benefits , help from children allows parents to have more spare time for their personal lives and for the children . A family can have more time to spend with each other talking , watching movies or just enjoying the beautiful moments . To sum up , I think that children should help their parents with household tasks", "Many people have to work under somebody's supervision . In most cases an employee does not choose his or her boss , unless a supervisor is elected . In the following paragraphs I will list the most important qualities of my \"ideal boss\" . First of all , he must be impartial . I believe that it is very important to make a technical decision , think about somebody's promotion , etc . impartially . For instance , my friend is a supervisor on a dairy mill . It is his family's business so a lot of his relatives work there . But he never promotes someone because he or she is his family . I think it is a good quality for a boss . Second of all , my \"ideal boss\" must be honest , patient and attentive . He should pay attention to people's feelings , encourage them by increasing their salary , listen to their suggestions about improving labor conditions and productivity . For instance , if he does not satisfied with the result he should understand the origin of the problem and explain people how to fix it . In addition , he must know how to solve conflicts that can arise between employees . Another important quality of a boss is the ability to choose the right decisions and to learn on somebody's mistakes . Finally , I think a good boss must value his or her employees because the profit directly depends on the people who work there", "Some people like to live in the same house , have the same job and habits all their lives . However , others aspire to changes and new experience . Personally , for the several reasons , which I will explain bellow , I prefer the first approach to life . First of all , changes in one's life bring many benefits . One tries new things , gains new knowledge and experience . I think it is great because without changes life becomes boring . I always try to make changes in my life . Moreover , when I feel that my life is boring I do not feel well about it . I feel like I spent those days for nothing . I did not do anything exiting , I learnt nothing interesting and I just waisted my time . Second of all , people need changes . Furthermore , we need obstacles to overcome and reach our goals . I believe that changes make us stronger , more persistent , more self-confident , and more patient . Also , I feel that all people who succeeded in life like changes and new experience because it is impossible to be the best at some field without perfecting the present knowledge and gain new experience . People catch every opportunity to learn more and change their life for the best . From the other side , people who like their lives to stay the same are very permanent . They have the same job all their life , the same habits , the same week-ends and even the same years in years out . I think it is boring . What will they tell their children about their lives? What kind of contribution will they make for the society? I think such people are just afraid of changes . I think curiosity and aspiration to the new experience are two of the main reasons of human evolution . People always wanted to break limits and gain more knowledge and experience", "I do not agree with the statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit . I state my opinion on the following points . First of all , every company must have its moral code . It means that a company should treat its clients properly and respect their rights . Of cause a company may lose a part of its profit but security of its clients must be on the first place . Otherwise , clients will switch to another company and never be back . For instance , a few years ago \"Jonson&Jonson\" produced a new type of painkillers . Unfortunately , this product was not tested properly . As a result of this many people died and received injures . The president of the company made a crucial decision to call back all painkillers from all distributors and pay to all injured customers for their treatment . It cost a lot of money for the company but it saved its image and clients . It was a very difficult decision , but the president of the company understood that it would cost him even more in the future because he would not be able to return clients' respect . Loosing customers means for a company loosing its profit . Second of all , in order to succeed in the modern world companies have to compete with each other . Many companies lose their profit decreasing prices on their products . They do not aspire for extra profit but for clients' satisfaction . Companies do it because they want their products sold and their customers satisfied . They offer discounts , free delivery , free service , free Internet access , good return service , etc . All these are done to make their old customers happy and attract new clients . To sum up , I think a company , which the only goal is profit will not succeed nowadays", "I would have to completely disagree with the statement above . In the following paragraphs I will outline the basic concepts of my position . First of all , I will least the major disadvantages for employers . On the today's market a company must be very flexible in order to compete with other firms . So , imagine the situation when a company can not fire its employees to stay on the market . It will lead to loosing not only a profit , but the clients , market share and competitive ability . Now , imagine the situation when a company is growing fast , everything is good and the next few years are going to be excellent . So , employers need more people to extend the production . However , nobody can tell what will happen in a few years . In this case , employers will be afraid to hire new people and extend their business because they will not be able to fire them if something goes wrong . Another important aspect of this is that a company can not have the best employees . It can not hire the better one without dismissing another employee . What kind of disadvantages will have an employee in exchange for this kind of job security? First of all , it will be very difficult to find a job if one is not the best , because an employer does not want to spend money on one's education . Besides , employer will not have a chance to fire one if he does not do his job well . Second of all , employees with this kind of security tend not to perfect themselves because after they are hired they can not lose their job . In conclusion , I would like to add that this statement has some positive aspects too such as constancy , a strong spirit of the company , etc . This system takes place in Japan and some companies succeeded in it . But I think that the reason of it subsists in the Japanese traditions , the particular cultural features , habits and customs", "Some people think that old , historic buildings are no need for the city and they should be destroyed and replaced with modern ones . However , other people believe that historic buildings must be preserved in order to know and remember our past . For several reasons that I will mention bellow I agree with those people who want to preserve old , historical buildings . First of all , by preserving historical buildings we pass our history to our future generations . I think that out children should know their history , learn from it and respect it . People need to know their traditions and customs , which are priceless and irreplaceable . Our history is our knowledge and power . From my opinion we need to preserve and restore historical buildings . By destroying them we show our disrespect to our forefathers and their traditions . Second of all , by preserving historical buildings a city can attract many travelers . Welcoming tourists a city can get many benefits including money , which can be spent on preserving historical buildings as well as on improving roads and facilities . Also , many tourists mean a lot of new business opportunities . Another important aspect of this is that businessmen will be willing to build new recreational centers , hotels , movie theaters , shopping centers to make a city more attractive for travelers . In addition to those practical benefits , many people will have the opportunity to get a job . All this is good for the economy of the city", "I think it is a great idea to build a new university in my community . However , I think it is a controversial question whether the building of a new university will bring only benefits to our community . In this essay I will analyze advantages and disadvantages of this issue and present my view in favor of establishing a new university in my community . From the one side , establishing a new university in my community brings many benefits . First of all , a new construction means more job opportunities . I think it would be good for my community because many people have to spend much time driving to their work day in and day out because they could not find a job in our neighborhood . Second of all , a new university is a good chance to meet new people and I like this opportunity . Many students will live in our community . Finally , if a new university is built in my community there is a big chance that I will be willing to enroll in it . I think it is great because it is not far from my place and I do not have to move to another part of the city . Another important aspect of this is that people from my community will have a chance to use new libraries and facilities of a new university . For example some people can take courses and classes there . From the other side , building a new university can bring some disadvantages . A new construction means noise , traffic jams and different kinds of pollution . In addition to these disadvantages , many young people in our community can cause more noise especially in the evenings . To sum up , I think that I would support the decision of the government of establishing a new university in my community despite a few disadvantages that could follow this construction", "I am from Saint-Petersburg , Russia . I believe that building a large factory near my community has advantages as well as disadvantages . In the following paragraphs I will list basic benefits and losses that will be brought by a new factory . For several reasons , I think that a new factory will not be a good addition to my neighborhood . First of all , factories often bring pollution . They are prone to contaminating the local air and water . Second of all , factories make noise . Another important aspect of building a new factory near by is that it will make the local traffic heavy . As a result of this , the amount of traffic congestions will increase , as well as contamination of the air . So , all these obviously will not make one's life happier and healthier in my community . From the other side , I believe that a new factory will bring some advantages to my community . First of all , it will bring new job opportunities . Many specialists will be required to work there . Second of all , I think many local community facilities will have to be renovated to obtain reliable supply of water and electricity . So , some old pipes may be changed . Another important benefit of this is that the local roads in order to manage the increasing traffic will be rebuilt and widened . However , I do not think that listed above benefits are worth all these troubles including water contamination and the constant pollution of air", "I live in a small community . From my everyday experience and observation I can say that the idea about building a new theatre in my neighborhood has some advantages as well as disadvantages . In this essay I will first focus on the reasons why I support this idea and then move on to analyzing why I oppose it . First of all , I like movies and my husband and I sometimes go to the movie theatre to watch premieres . Unfortunately , it is time-consuming for us . We have to drive about 50 minutes to the nearest movies theatre . So , the idea of having a movie theatre in our neighborhood seems very attractive . It would save us an hour just to get there and another hour to get back home . Another important aspect of it is that in this case we will be able to get to the movie theatre by foot . I must to confess that we always have parking troubles in the parking space near the movie theatre . Second of all , new movie theatre is a very good place for students who want to earn some money . My husband and I live near a student community , so I think it would be a great news for them . In addition to this practical benefit students will be able to watch all movies free of charge . I suppose it is a great way to save some money . Finally , there are usually many restaurants and entertaining centers around a movie theatre . There people can have dinner or play game machines . In contrast , I think that the building of a new movie theatre will destroy the silence and beauty of out community . Such entertaining centers are often noisy . Moreover , traffic jams will probably be the result of it", "Some people think that fiction books have no use at all . They claim that people should read about real events that took place , real people , and established facts . I have to totally disagree with this statement . From my everyday experience and observation I can stand that fiction , miracles and fairy tails are required in our life . For several reasons , which I will mention below , I believe that fiction books play an essential role in our life . First of all , it is kind of difficult to imagine a six year old child reading about politics or history with the real facts that are not always pleasant . I think that children need miracles and Santa Claus because the real world is too complicated for them . They are too innocent and inexperienced to know the real facts and understand what a real life is about . In addition , I am sure that making a child read only non-fiction books can result in shock . Second of all , following this statement about refusing from reading books about fiction events we also should refuse from festivals , parades , and celebration such holidays as Halloween because most of the characters there are fictional . Moreover , comic books will disappear as well as animated films and fiction movies . The disadvantage of non-fiction lies in the facts that nothing happens to excite the mind and spirit . From the other side , fiction provides a great slope for a mind to think creatively . In conclusion , I think that people need miracles . We can not be satisfied with only naked truth", "People are learning and practicing through their entire life . I believe that life experience and practice are the basic reasons of the humankind's evolution . However , in my opinion , knowledge gained from books plays a very important role in the modern life . The most obviously important advantage of books is that they hold all knowledge gained by previous generations . People write books about their discoveries and inventions , which are gained through practice and experience . This knowledge is accumulated in books that are passed from generation to generation . So , basically , people get all knowledge about the previous achievements from books , analyze it and than , according to their experience and new data , write new books . In this case , books are the holders of humankind's experience . For example , at old times people thought that the Earth was flat . It was concluded from observations and studdying . However , the next generations , using the experience of their ancestors , proved that the Earth was round . Personally , I think that books are very important because they are able to give people the basic and fundamental knowledge . Books store history , the important events and discoveries . Without them it is difficult and sometimes impossible to move forward , make new discoveries and inventions . To summarize , I think a person should take basic knowledge from books because it will help him to make his own inventions , conclusions and discoveries", "As human's population is dramatically rising every year , people's requirements are increasing too . We need more food , more fresh water , more places to live . As a result of this many parts of the world are losing essential and sometimes irreplaceable resources , such as forest , animals , or fresh water . In this essay I will focus on the threat of disappearing many wild animals . The reason why I think that animals should be preserved is that all living creatures on this planet are connected with each other . So , the disappearance of only one species can cause dramatic changes in the planet and even death of many other living creatures . For example , the disappearance of bats will cause the huge increasing of insect population and this will reflect on all animals and plants . Another example is that if the population of bats increases , the population of insects will decrease significantly , and this will cause the disappearance of many plants because insects are the main pollinators . So , I think it is very important to preserve all species on our planet and live in harmony with our environment . Another important reason why I think that animals should be saved is that I , personally , do not want my child to learn about different animals from books and not be able to see them alive . I think it is shameful for humankind to explain our children that we are the reason why those animals disappeared . In conclusion , I would like to say that the issue about losing important natural resources is topical and open for debate nowadays . I believe that together people can make a difference . From my point of view , the first problem we should find a solution for is human's overpopulation . As I mentioned above people's demands are growing and this means we consume more and more natural resources", "As human population is significantly rising every year , people's requirements are increasing too . We need more food , more machines , more place to live . As a result of this people need more land to satisfy their requirements . We cultivate and irrigate more and more land to plant vegetables , build new buildings , airports , roads , etc . I think sometimes we forget that we are not alone on this planet . I have to disagree with those people who think that human needs are more important than saving land for endangered animals . I base my opinion on the following points . First of all , as I already mentioned , we are not alone on this planet . A few centuries ago we were the part of wild nature . I think we need to remember this fact and respect all creatures around us . Second of all , I believe that we all need to think of the problem of overpopulation . The human population is dramatically increasing and we have to do something about it . From my opinion , every family should have no more than two children . It will help to stop the growth of population , decrease human needs for farmland , housing and industry . In conclusion , I think it is a very topical question nowadays", "From my everyday experience and observation I can stand that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience . However , some people think that it is wiser to learn about life through listening to the advice of family and friends . It does not mean I totally disagree with this way of learning . Moreover , I think that it is wise for a person to take an intermediate position because each of these ways has its own advantages . Bellow I will give my reasons to support my point of view . From the one side , learning through one's personal experience brings many benefits . First of all , scientists say that personal experience has greater impact on a person . I have to agree with this . Take for example children . They will not believe their parents that something can hurt them until they try it and make sure in it . Furthermore , most likely they will remember this experience longer . Second of all , people learn how to analyze their mistakes , make conclusions and next time try to avoid them . So , I think it is a great experience that makes people stronger , more self-confident and persistent . They gain more knowledge and experience that will be very helpful and valuable in the future . From the other side , listening to the advice of family and friends brings many benefits too . Parents with great patience pass down their knowledge and experience to their children . They teach them all they know and they want their children do not make the same mistakes . In addition to those practical benefits , learning from someone's advice is painless . For example , parents nowadays very often talk to their children about drugs . I think it is a great example when one should not try drugs in order to gain new experience . I think it is a case when children must trust their parents . To sum up , I think it is wise to combine both of these ways to learn and try to analyze personal mistakes as well as not personal", "Form my everyday experience and observation I think that all people who succeeded in life had to work hard and gain more knowledge and experience in order to reach their goals . From the other hand , people who all their life do things they already do well and do not improve their knowledge do not move forward . I base my statement on the following points . First of all , people who want to succeed must constantly improve their knowledge and gain more experience . Moreover , they must be the best at their profession . So , they need to try new things , take risks sometimes and work hard . Second of all , it is impossible to live without trying new things . Imagine one wants to learn how to drive . He will never be able to do it without learning new things such as driving rules . Personally , I think that it is very interesting to learn new , to gain more experience , to make new goals and reach them . Life is too short to stay on one place . People need changes because they make our lives more beautiful and exiting . We find out new things , learn new things and dream to know other things . People need challenges because while overcoming obstacles we make new discoveries , become stronger , perfect ourselves and move forward . To sum up , I believe that people's aspiration for learning new things is the main reason the way we live now", "I think that everyone can divide all advertising products and services into useless ones and useful ones . It is like looking through an information desk when you pay attention to those messages that interest you . Take me for example . I do not like jewelry . It does not mean I do not have it at all , I have a couple of inexpensive rings as gifts from my parents . I just think , people pay too much attention to this stuff . I believe it is the result of mass advertising . Every day when I am watching TV , listening to the radio or reading the paper I notice many ads about getting an expensive ring , chain , necklace or ear-rings . From my point of view these kinds of advertising contaminate people's minds . In this case you are encouraged to buy things you do not really need . They make you believe you need such products in order to succeed or be happy . From the other side , I think that advertisements of the new detergents with up-to-date formulas to help you maintain your cloth in perfect conditions , the new cars with some extra futures that make your traveling more comfortable and sports goods that make your life healthier may help you to improve your life . Recently my husband and I saw an ad on the Internet about a very interesting and inexpensive vocation to Japan for a week . Is not it awesome? We like traveling . So now we are planning to find out more about it and , may be , make reservations . I believe that without advertisements we would be unaware about plenty of oppotunities that may make your life happier , easier and less stressful . My point is that every person has his own scale of values", "Every country has its own culture and traditions . There is no doubt that an advertising campaign conducted in Russia will not have the same affect here in the United States . Let us take for example advertisement of food and restaurants . A huge amount of fast food stands suggest their services for breakfast , lunch , dinner and supper here in Houston . The competition is very strong . Every week you get in your mail-box an envelope with different types of discounts in exchange for visiting them or ordering pizza . Watching TV you are also from time to time invited to visit a restaurant in order to taste some delicious food . It is not because it is easy to make money cooking but because the demand for such service is high . First of all , people like to go out sometimes to have dinner with friends . Second of all , it is often impossible to drive home for lunch . It can be time consuming . As for Russia , it is a great tradition to have dinner at home with the family and go to the restaurant for big holidays . Additionally fast food is not popular in Russia . So you will see advertisements of yogurts , coffee , dairy products and juice instead of restaurants and fast food stands", "Nowadays people have so many things to do that they almost always do not have enough time for it . When we go to bed we carefully think and plan our next day and it continues day in and day out . We wake up , recollect our checklist with things to do and in a few minutes we are already in a car on our way to the office . Often people do not have time for themselves . So , when people have some spare time they want to use it wisely . Some people prefer to plan activities for their free time very carefully . However , others prefer not to make any plans . In this essay I will analyze both cases and present my view in favor of planning free-time activities . From the one side , not making any plans and just letting the time pass by for some time have some benefits . First of all , a person can just relax , enjoy the beautiful moments , spend his or her time with loved ones , watch a movie , listen to relaxing music , observe the flowers in bloom from the window , contemplate about his or her life and just slow down the pace of life . I think it is a very good way to eliminate one's stress and tension and just leave all troubles and worries behind . From the other side , careful planning can bring many benefits too . First of all , one can travel . However , traveling requires some planning to be made . For example , one most likely will need a hotel room . So , the reservation should be made beforehand . Also , it is wise to check one's car to avoid breakdowns and have an uninterrupted worry-free trip . Second of all , planning one's activities allows to spend one's free time the way he/she likes . For instance , if I want to play tennis on incoming week-end I will certainly make a reservation for a court because in this case I will not be disappointed with the waste of my time . Personally , I prefer to make plans for my free time because it allows me to spend my vacation or week-ends the way I want it . To sum up , I think careful planning allows people to derive maximum benefits from their free time", "Man , through the ages , has undergone many changes from the time when he depicted a herd of mammoths on the walls of his cave to these days when he can create beautiful pictures and even make coffee by use of computer technologies without leaving his favorite chair . The 20th century made huge steps in developing computer technologies and reached many goals that made our life much easier . What should we expect in the 21st century? First of all , I think that the pace of our life will speed up: we will move faster from one place to another , from one continent to another using high speed jet airplanes . Second of all , I believe that we will be able to do many things that take much time now without leaving our house . Computers will be everywhere including out clothes . Many people will have chips and mini computers inserted in their heads to hold huge amount of information and have a quick access to it . But what will be the most amazing thing in the 21st century is the flights to the outer space and Mars that will be available to all people . Scientists say that Mars has many things similar to the Earth's . Moreover , they say that with the help of modern technology people can artificially create conditions that will allow people to live there on the constant basis . To sum up , I am sure that many amazing changes will be brought by the 21st century . Furthermore , I think that with the help of the contemporary technologies people can do many things that were even difficult to imagine a century ago", "Different countries have different education systems . I don\u201bt know all the education systems in the world but all the ones I do know about have free school education at primary and secondary level . I certainly agree with the statement that this should be the case . I believe university education is different . No matter what standard of income someone has or what society someone comes from , everyone should have the opportunity to have a good standard of education . This is not always what happens but it is what should happen . Private schools can be available for those who want and can afford it but the free schools should always be there . This is certainly one of the best attributes of western democracy and all countries it seems strive to attain situation although some have problems due to the economic and political situations in their countries . Governments should make sure that all their citizens have access to a good standard of free education at primary and secondary level . Further education is different . In an ideal world this should be free but governments have a lot of demands on their money . I think that students should have to pay , maybe not all , but at least a contribution towards their tuition fees . They will be able to earn it back once they have graduated . The UK has this system whereas in the US students have to pay all their high tuition fees which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars over a full course . I am not sure if I agree with this but it certainly would make sure that students make the best of efforts to pass or all their money would be wasted", "It is clear to me that the idea of a single global currency is an excellent ideal to work towards . There can be no doubt that trade and travel would be vastly easier . On the other hand I believe that it would cause problems today . The benefits of a single currency can be seen with the use in Europe of the Euro . Whenever you are travelling between countries using the Euro , the problems of currency changing and exchange rates are history . Similarly business between countries using the Euros is so much easier; no more worrying about exchange rate risk and pricing . Everyone\u201bs money is the same . The same thing is true with the US dollar . Most countries do not use the US dollar but it is accepted in many places . There are many countries that you can travel to and just take US dollars to use . At present though a global currency would be impossible . Firstly most countries would not accept the idea . Secondly all countries are in different economic states . Some are economically very strong and some are in a state of collapse with inflation ruining the economy . Such countries could not be brought into a world currency as it would cause massive financial instability worldwide . So it is clear that a global currency would indeed cause some serious problems . So , in conclusion I see a global currency as a future ideal but it will not happen in my lifetime", "Every day the rich countries in the world get richer and the poor countries get poorer . Can we reduce this gap? Of course we can . The question is whether the people in power want to do it? Reducing the wealth gap can be achieved by cancelling third world debt , cancelling trade and farming subsidies so that third world countries can compete , getting rid of third world corruption and investing and building in third world countries using local people and skills and allowing them ownership of businesses . There are other things as well . Unfortunately there is no profit in business for first world countries to do these things . Some will do them but most will not . The ordinary man on the street wants things to be better for poorer countries and the politicians say that they will help but the politicians will in the end do what business tells them to do . Politicians also rightly feel they have a duty to protect their own countries and keeping economically dominant is part of this duty . Creating effective competition for their own country\u201bs businesses is not part of what they are expected to do . This then leads on to whether I believe that developed countries have a duty to help the developing countries . Yes , I do . As an individual I believe that we have a duty to assist the poorer countries with their development in all aspects . We can provide teachers and education and doctors on the small scale and on the larger scale the things that I have talked about in the previous paragraph . Can we do this? Yes . Will we do this? See the previous paragraph again . In conclusion you can see that I believe that there is a split between what would happen in a perfect world and what actually happens", "The more people that there are in the world , the more cars there are on the road . People are richer too and often families have more than one car . It has been proved that building more roads does not work; it just encourafes more traffic . So , what can we do? People like their cars and the freedom and independence that cars give them . One possibility would be to raise car taxes and fuel taxes so that people do not want to spend the extra money . Taxes on new car sales as well could be increased in order to discourage people from buying . Perhaps a used car sales tax could be introduced too . In the same way motorways could have tolls charged for using them although this may just increase congestion on smaller roads as people try and avoid the motorways . The government that introduces such ideas will not be popular though and would probably lose power . Governments would therefore be unlikely to set up such new measures . I think it would be better to try and change people\u201bs attitudes and offer them alternatives . Educate them more about the pollution and waste that they are causing . Persuade them to car share , use public transport or even cycle if the distances are not too long . Countries such as Holland and Denmark are well known for how their citizens are passionate about green issues and how they use bicycles when they can . Reducing traffic is a difficult task", "The question of whether the amount of violence on TV and cinema has affected young people in our society is something which cannot be quantified or proved . My opinion is though that the answer is \u201cyes , it has\u201d . TV and cinema today do show a large amount of violence and , although we try and shield our young people from seeing too much , they still get to watch it . At the age of eighteen in my country they can see everything anyway . Violence on the streets has increased . That has been proved . The connection between TV\u201bs and the cinema\u201bs obsession with violence and today\u201bs street violence cannot be proved but it is logical that the two are connected . Young people imitate what they see and it is logical that they see glamour in what they do when they commit violence . How can we lessen violence? Reducing the amount of violence on TV and in the cinema would certainly be a good start . Being more vigilant about what age children are when they see violence in these media , and raising the age limits would also help . Another good idea would be to channel the violence of young people . I don\u201bt think that national service should be re-established in this country but , if people are convicted of violence and sent to prison , then why not give them the option of serving in the army . Their violence will be controlled and they will be subjected to discipline so that they will be better able to control themselves when they leave . Thus I agree with the statement that cinema and TV violence affects the young people in our society", "What young people should study at school has long been the subject of intense debate and this is a question that certainly does not have one correct answer . We need to provide young people the best possible chance of doing well at school . In traditional curriculum there is a wide variety of subjects with a mix of academic and non-academic subjects . In this way a young person is formed with a rounded education . Non-academic subjects would include sports , cooking , woodwork and metalwork . I believe this is the best form of education . A young person should learn things other than academic subjects . Sport is particularly important . Young people have to learn to love sport so that they can be fit and healthy later in life . If not we will be raising an obese and unfit generation . I totally understand the point of view that education is so important that students must be pushed as hard as possible to achieve their best . It sounds a good idea to only expose the students to academic subjects as then they can spend all of their school hours on studying areas that will get them into university and good jobs later in life . I just feel a more rounded education would produce a better individual . We must remember too that a lot of people , maybe even most people , aren\u201bt academically minded and would benefit more from a more vocationally based education . Forcing academic studies onto them would lead to failure and the student leaving school too early", "Over the past few decades , the world has significantly changed . Nowadays , many have begun to wonder what the reasons behind [=for] these changes are . Two major factors contributing to this phenomenon are advances in media and change family dynamics [=organization] . First , advances in media , such as the Internet and TV , have meant that children spend a large portion of their leisure time in front of a screen . Consequently , they are not getting proper amounts of exercise , which results in an increase in the number of children who are overweight and obese . In addition , fast food restaurants have become increasingly popular , which has also contributed to children's health problems Moreover , another leading force of this trend is changes in the family unit . Compared with a half century ago , nuclear families have become way more common in modern society . People tend to have only one child , which has caused personality disorders such as depression , loneliness , and selfishness . This is mainly because parents with one child have tendency to put all their focus and money into their only son or daughter . Studies have indicated that over 65% of children who are brought up without siblings show self-centered behavior find it difficult cooperating with their peers . In summary , there are many factors that have caused children to live very differently from the generation before them", "Over the past few decades , academic subjects have become increasingly important in this fast-changing information-based society . Nowadays , there has been a growing debate as to whether it would be more effective to replace physical education classes with academic subjects . Despite the importance of sports , I highly believe that it is inevitable and more efficient to focus more on academic subjects for several reasons . Those who argue that sports and exercise classes are needed in school base their case on the following arguments . First of all , sports are a good way to build character and develop personality . That is , there are necessary for learning about competition , cooperation , and good sportsmanship . In addition , as a majority of children these days are addicted to the Internet , they find it hard to leave their computer . Consequently , a growing number of children are becoming overweight or obese due to a lack of exercise . So , if schools foster an environment that deprives students of getting a proper physical education , it will have a long-term negative effect on children both mentally and physically . Nevertheless , people should not ignore the fact that devoting more time and energy to academic subjects will benefit students more in the long run . The time devoted to physical education now would be better spent teaching students English . This is because speaking fluent English will give young people an advantage over other college applicants and job seekers in the near future . Besides , science will undoubtedly benefit youth more than physical education as well . The principles learned in science will provide the necessary foundation for solving and difficult problems that are sure to arise in students' futures", "Over the past few decades [In the past] , there have been many advances in medical technology . Because of this , senior citizens are healthier and more active than before and may choose to work beyond the age of 65 . Nowadays , however , there has been a growing debate as to whether or not these people should retire in order to create jobs for the younger generation . Despite the advantages of early retirement , I strongly believe that it is better for senior workers to continue working as long as they are physically and mentally capable . Those who believe that senior workers need to retire for younger generation base their case on the following arguments . First , the unemployment rate , especially for college graduates , has never been so high so it is today . This is largely due to the slow economy . Therefore , firing some elderly workers who are well-paid would allow those unemployed young people to have good opportunities to get a job . In addition , replacing older workers with young people would bring greater benefits to companies [=employers] . This is because youngsters are better at adapting themselves to fast changing information based society . They are generally better at computers and speaking foreign languages than their older counterparts . Nevertheless , people should not ignore the fact that senior citizens have been playing vital roles both at home and at work for their entire lives . To begin with , a young person's need for a job is no more important than an older person's . Both have a responsibility to support their families . Sadly , few seniors can afford early retirement . Besides , senior workers provide the wisdom and experience that young employees cannot offer . There is strong [=acute] possibility of situations arising that require the knowledge of skilled senior employees . In summary , the advantages of keeping seasoned workers far outweigh its disadvantages", "High school students face many decisions as they prepare to graduate , including what they are going to do after graduation . Some high school students go directly to college or university after graduation . Others prefer to travel or work for some time before going to university . For those who choose to go college or university after graduation , there are advantages and disadvantages . One of the big advantages of going directly from high school to college is that you are still in the habit of studying . By going to college after graduation , you do not lose the study skills that you developed during high school . The big disadvantages , however , is that you may not be ready for college . You may not know exactly what you want to study , or you may be more interested in freedom and parties than in your courses . At that age , it is often difficult for students to take on the responsibilities of college . There are also advantages and disadvantages to working or traveling befor starting college . Working or traveling allows you a better idea of what you want to do with your life . You gain practical experience that helps you define what you want to study . You also are well prepared for the responsibilities of college or university studies . On the other hand , by the time you start college , you will probably have obligations , like a job or spouse , which keep you from focusing on studies . In addition , travelling or working before college may cause you to spend enough time out of school that you forget how to study . The desicion of what to do after hich school graduation can be a difficult one . Deciding whether to go straight into college or university or take time to work or travel is something that faces every high school student", "Over the past few decades , along with growing interest in child education , people's attention to the family environment where a child is brought up has also significantly increased . Some people have begun to feel that a child who has grown up in a poor family tend to be better prepared to deal with problems . In my opinion , however , family environment alone does not much influence a child's ability to solve problems . A child who was born into a poor family would have had more situations where they had to solve a problem or make a decision on their own . This is because in most unfortunate families , both parents are usually working and children are put into situations where they have to take care of themselves . By contrast , due to their wealth , rich children can experience and learn things that unfortunate children cannot . For example , they usually go to the best schools and receive a higher education there , which prepares them better for solving problems in their life . However , few would disagree with the fact that each individual is different . That is , problem solving skills come more from life experience . That is , the more a person experiences in life , the more they can use these experiences to adjust , to adapt and to solve problems they encounter . Personality also can be a factor in dealing with problems . A person who is optimistic , outgoing , confident and open-minded can look at and solve problems more effectively . As discussed above , nature and nurture have an equal influence on a child's ability to face challenges . Parents should spare no effort to figure out how they can help their children to be independent", "Over the past few decades , the increasing amount of industrial wastes and household garbage has become a major problem in many countries . People have questioned what caused this problem and what can be done to improve the situation . In my opinion , two of the most critical causes of this waste material problem are the increased consumption and a shortage of space for landfill . To begin with , modern lifestyle has contributed greatly to the increasing amount of waste and garbage we produce everyday . In other words , we have turned into a materialistic and mass-consumption society where we use more and throw away more than ever before . Moreover , countries are running out of space to store garbage and waste material . In fact , securing land for waste disposal raises controversies in many countries . To solve this intractable problem , every citizen needs to participate in producing less garbage . For example , we can bring our own personal shopping bags instead of using plastic bags provided by stores and shops . Besides , the government can enforce stricter laws on companies to use biodegradable packaging or use recycled material . Indeed , this alone can eliminate much of the waste which is sent to at land fills . Companies can also contribute by developing new raw material which is recyclable and will ultimately lead to less garbage . One good example of this is that tire companies develop new tires for cars which are not made of rubber but of new biodegradable material . As discussed above , individuals , business and the government can share the responsibility to reduce the amount of waste material and to save the earth", "Many old people in Britain , after a lifetime of hard work and the toil of bringing up children , are put into homes for the elderly by their families . There , they are looked after by professional nurses , and this is sometimes at the expense of the government . However , this situation has raised controversy about whether we extend to our elders the care and respect they deserve . The critics of this system say that it is the duty of the family to look after its senior members in the years when they are no longer able to work . They point out that in retirement homes old people tend to feel useless and unwanted by their family members , who seldom come to see them . In addition , there is evidence that younger people benefit from the experience and wisdom of older people who live with them on a daily basis . On the other had , those who support the system say that retired parents can be a burden to young families . Not only is it expensive to support old people who have little or no income , but the fact that old people are often ill and need a great deal of looking after can be too much for their busy children . In my opinion , neither side is completely right . Old people in good health and with enough finances to support themselves can be a great help to their children . For instance , they can look after their grandchildren while children are out at work", "Movies tend to have a very large influence on young people who are influenced both by what they see and hear . Because this is the case , it is true that car chases in action movies tend to lead to an increase in the number of car accidents among young drivers because they try to copy what they have seen in the films . They drive too fast and take unnecessary risks and the difficulty is that most young people lack the skills and experience to do this . There are a variety of ways in which young people can be encouraged to practise safer driving habits . Firstly , the Government should launch a safe driving campaign to convey the fact that driving safely is not uncool . In effect , it should be cool to stay alive and healthy! Secondly , every movie should make it clear that dangerous car chases are undertaken only in strict safety conditions with experienced drivers , and often special movie-making tricks are used to enhance the action . Thirdly , young people should be forced to take safe driving courses every year for the first five years that they have their driver's licence . In this way , they are forced to perfect their driving skills or their licence will be taken away . Finally , as part of this course , young drivers should go to hospitals and witness the effects of poor or dangerous driving on other people . When they see hospitalised people whose lives have been destroyed due to stupid risk-taking , they will surely change their minds about whether it is cool to copy action heroes and drive fast", "Every year , millions of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research into the effects of drugs , food additives , cosmetics and other chemical products . While most people think animal testing is necessary , others are upset by what they see as needless suffering . This essay looks at some of the positive and negative aspects of animal testing . Many medical treatments and procedures have been developed from experiments on animals . Since animals share many features with humans , scientists use animals to test the safety and effectiveness of newly developed drugs before pilot testing on small groups of patients . Medical teams practice new operating techniques such as transplants on animals . Without animal testing , many procedures or new drugs would be extremely unsafe . However , many people are concerned that animals are suffering unnecessarily and cruelly . They do not believe that every new drug needs to be tested on animals , especially with the huge database of knowledge and modern computer models . They also are worried that many animal tests are ineffective , pointing out that any drugs have had to be withdrawn from the market despite extensive testing . They particularly feel that animal testing should not be used for non-essential products such as cosmetics , shampoos , soaps , and cleaning products . Furthermore , some campaigners would like to see certain tests replaced and more humane methods used . We need to make sure that the millions of animals who are used for testing new products are treated with the minimum of suffering . Although some animal testing may be unavoidable at present , treating our fellow creatures as mercifully as possible will demonstrate our humanity", "city has its architectural character , but the similarities between cities are more obvious these days than in the past . In my opinion , one reason for this is the high price of land . In most large cities , land is scarce and consequently it is very valuable . This has led to the construction of tall buildings which occupy only a small area of land while providing lots of floor space where people can live or work . Buildings of this type are made of concrete and steel and can be built comparatively quickly using prefabricated materials . They do not use local materials , such as stone , timber or brick , which used to give cities their individual character . In consequence many cities . now look very much the same and you might not know whether you were in Brisbane , Bangkok or Berlin when you are on the street . While I realise that we cannot stand in the way of progress , I believe that cities should try to keep some individuality . For example , in Paris it is prohibited to build very tall buildings in the centre of the city , as this would spoil the overall appearance of the skyline . Other cities have chosen to design unique buildings to ensure they look different . The twin towers in Kuala Lumpur or the Opera House in Sydney are examples of this approach , and I agree with this kind of initiative . All in all , although it is regrettable that modern cities look similar , I tend to feel that this is unavoidable", "It has been widely noted that , with the growing use of computers and calculators both in the classroom and in the home , the level of literacy and mathematical ability of students is dropping . This raises serious doubts about the value of the progress of science and technology . Here I will discuss the pros and cons of this question . First of all , advances in science and technology have certainly brought about many benefits for mankind . They have made our lives more comfortable and healthier . In addition , they have eased the burden of work for most people and provided them with more leisure opportunities , while at the same time increasing productivity dramatically . Nevertheless , it cannot be denied that technology has some negative side-effects . As mentioned above , with computers which check spelling , grammar and calculation for them , students have little incentive to learn how to do these things for themselves . Also , the availability of TV programs and videos encourages an unhealthy , sedentary lifestyle . Another aspect of this issue is that technology may be good or bad , depending on how we use it . For instance , dynamite may be used to make road construction easier , or it may be used to kill people . Again , nuclear reactors can supply huge amounts of cheap electricity , but if they are carelessly handled they can cause devastating pollution . We can conclude that the progress of science and technology has both positive and negative effects . What we must do is to make sure that the positive ones are encouraged and the negative ones are eliminated as far as possible", "A criticism often heard these days is that the subjects taught in schools tend to be too academic , and contribute little to preparing a young person for the real-life tasks he or she will have to perform after graduation . They say that academic subjects are rooted in the past , and are not useful for solving modern problems . I disagree with this point of view for three reasons . My first reason is that it is the duty of parents , not teachers , to prepare their children to deal with the practical affairs of life . The home , not the classroom , is the ideal place to learn about home management and interpersonal skills . As for work abilities and attitudes , they are best learned \u201con the job\u201d and under the supervision of an experienced older worker . My second reason is that academic subjects have withstood the test of time . They represent the accumulated wisdom of our ancestors down through the ages , and , far from being impractical , they equip us with the knowledge and confidence to make sound judgements about any problems which may crop up . In addition , academic subjects are good for training us in mental discipline , while practical subjects are weak in this regard . My third reason is based on the saying \u201cMan does not live by bread alone . \u201d Schooldays devoted solely to instruction in down-to-earth practical matters would be dull indeed! Lessons in the best literature of the world , and the epoch-making scientific and geographical discoveries of the past enrich our lives and make us feel that we are part of the great family of mankind . All in all , the teaching of academic subjects in schools is entirely appropriate . It is my firmly held view that practical subjects have no place in the classroom", "Before talking about the essential role of death penalty , you have to think about the meaning , and the purpose , of any kind of punishment . If you consider that the purpose is to prevent the guilty from being nasty again , you can be seduced by an argumentation in favour of the suppression of capital punishment . But you have to think about another aspect of the problem: a punishment is also useful to impress people , to make them fear the law . In fact , let's take the example of a young misfit , which has grown in a violent atmosphere , influenced by older delinquents , etc . He lives in the streets , he's got no aim but to survive . This is the kind of person who could possibly kill someone for money , or even for fun . Why would he fear prison? Life would be easier for him there . In addition , in many cases , when you behave normally , you can benefit from penalty reductions . This young misfit needs to be impressed , he needs to know that the law is a frontier . When you cross it , you can lose your life . That is why capital punishment helps keeping a distance between robbery and murder . If you abolish it , you suppress the difference between these two types of crime , which are completely different . But there is also a limit to define: even if death penalty is unavoidable , it would be a crime to apply it to inadequate cases . If there is no premeditation or past facts which can justify such a punishment , it is far too strict to apply death penalty . That is why the lawmakers have to establish precisely the context in which capital punishment car be pronounced", "There is no doubt that going to study in a foreign country , with its different language and culture , can be a frustrating and sometimes painful experience . But while overseas study has its drawbacks , the difficulties are far outweighed by the advantages . Indeed , people who go abroad for study open themselves up to experiences that those who stay at home will never have . The most obvious advantage to overseas university study is real-life use of a different language . While a person can study a foreign language in his or her own country , it cannot compare with constant use of the language in academic and everyday life . There is no better opportunity to improve second-language skills than living in the country in which it is spoken . Moreover , having used the language during one's studies offers a distinct advantage when one is applying for jobs back home that require the language . On a university campus , the foreign student is not alone in having come from far away . He or she will likely encounter many others from overseas and it is possible to make friends from all around the world . This is not only exciting on a social level , but could lead to important overseas contacts in later professional life . Finally , living and studying abroad offers one a new and different perspective of the world and , perhaps most important , of one's own country . Once beyond the initial shock of being in a new culture , the student slowly begins to get a meaningful understanding of the host society . On returning home , one inevitably sees one's own country in a new , often more appreciative , light", "Of course it goes without saying that prevention is better than cure . That is why , in recent years , there has been a growing body of opinion in favour of putting more resources into health education and preventive measures . The argument is that ignorance of , for example , basic hygiene or the dangers of an unhealthy diet or lifestyle needs to be combatted by special nationwide publicity campaigns , as well as longer-term health education . Obviously , there is a strong human argument for catching any medical condition as early as possible . There is also an economic argument for doing so . Statistics demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of treating a condition in the early stages , rather than delaying until more expensive and prolonged treatment is necessary . Then there are social or economic costs , perhaps in terms of loss of earnings for the family concerned or unemployed benefit paid by the state . So far so good , but the difficulties start when we try to define what the 'proportion' of the budget should be , particularly if the funds will be 'diverted from treatment' . Decisions on exactly how much of the total health budget should be spent in this way are not a matter for the non-specialist , but should be made on the basis of an accepted health service model . This is the point at which real problems occur - the formulation of the model", "It is known that humans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems , but we can also take steps to minimize the damages that we are causing to the planet . This essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems . Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste . Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming , which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future . As the human population increases , we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste , which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans . Governments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution . They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar , wind or water power . They could also impose \u2018green taxes\u2019 on drivers and airline companies . In this way , people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad , therefore reducing emissions . Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment . They can take public transport rather than driving , choose products with less packaging , and recycle as much as possible . Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as \u2018banks\u2019 for recycling glass , plastic and paper in their car parks . By reusing and recycling , we can help to reduce waste", "In this modern world , perspectives of how to keep animals are varied among people . Some people think about caging them in zoos or forests while others think it is illogical to limit animals\u2019 movements . I am going to discuss these views according to environmental , personal and economic perspectives . Keeping some animals in zoos will protect them against predators , bad weather , and food inavailability . Nevertheless , keeping animals free is more logical than isolating them because if we keep animals caged , they would not be able to have fresh air and chase other animals . Therefore , it is cruel keeping animals confined in small spaces . It is advisable to put our efforts into keeping our creatures in their natural habitats , in order to give them the opportunity to experience normal life . Keeping animals is essential because some animals are in fact becoming extinct . Although keeping these animals is costly , the profits made by keeping these animals are substantial . Take Indian lions for example; a wide range of people travel to India to see these animals in circuses in India . However , some people think that governments should invest the money in improving the infrastructure of their nations instead . Building new electrical power station , for instance , is more important than spending thousands of pounds to preserve certain creatures from extinction . Lastly , keeping animals is important for study and research whereas others think we have no right to use animals for entertainment and in labs . To conclude , keeping animals in zoos might have values but it is irrational to keep these animals away from their natural habitat", "It is believed that men and women should have the same educational opportunities . However , I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject . This essay will explain the reasons why admitting equal numbers of male and female students in every major is impractical . First , having the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic . Student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives . If a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females , it would need enough applicants of each gender . In reality , many courses are more popular with one gender than the other , and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions . For example , nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants , and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty percent of the places needed to go to males . Apart from the practical concerns expressed above , I also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender . Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications . In this way , both men and women have the same opportunities , and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school . If a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course , it would be wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications", "Some people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society . I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible . On the one hand , I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens . In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way . It is possible to find homeless people , for example , in even the wealthiest of cities , and for those who are concerned about this problem , there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people . In the UK , people can help in a variety of ways , from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen . As the problems are on our doorstep , and there are obvious ways to help , I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity . At the same time , I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders . In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities , and it is often even easier to help . For example , when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries , governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist . A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area", "It is true that happiness is very important in people's life , but some people have different views about how to be happy . This essay will discuss the reasons that makes happiness difficult to understand and the things how to attain it . There are things that can make a person happy , while others do not such as a stable job , a beautiful house , or winning a lottery . A person will be happy with his life if he is able to feed his family by having a permanent job . Also , if the house is decent , he will be happy to see how comfortable life is to live in a place with wonderful furniture and appliances . Finally , winning a huge sum of money is a dream coming true for most people . However , others do not like to buy lottery tickets because some people believe that once they have won the lottery , they might put their family's life at risk , perhaps , they think somebody will try to kidnap their kids and ask for a ransom . On the other hand , there are simple factors in attaining happiness . For example , when a family of five could meet the basic needs such as food , clothing and a house , these could make a family satisfied with what they already have in life as long as they are together . Another example is being able to pass an English proficiency test to be qualified to become a registered nurse in Canada . Most foreign workers would be very glad if they could pursue their career after passing such a test", "In my opinion , an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities . I completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society . Education is an important factor with regard to personal success in life . I believe that all children should have access to free schooling , and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who choose to pursue a university degree . In a society without free schooling or affordable higher education , only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities , and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market . This kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others . I would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people\u2019s freedom to succeed or fail . In other words , equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed , or that they are not allowed to fail . On the contrary , I believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society . Those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity . Inequality , on the other hand , would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds", "People have different views about the role and function of museums . In my opinion , museums can and should be both entertaining and educational . On the one hand , it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain . Museums are tourist attractions , and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people want to see . The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content , so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning . This type of museums is designed to be visually spectacular , and it may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions . On the other hand , some people argue that museums should focus on education . The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know . Usually this means that the history behind the museum\u2019s exhibits needs to be explained , and this can be done in various ways . Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors , while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition . This way , museums can play an important role in teaching people about history , culture , science and many other aspects of life", "When they finish school , teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education . While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school , I would argue that it is better to go to college or university . The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons . Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible . In this way , they can become independent , and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family . In terms of their career , young people who decide to find work , rather than continue their studies , may progress more quickly . They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession . This may lead to promotions and a successful career . On the other hand , I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies . Firstly , academic qualifications are required in many professions . For example , it is impossible to become a doctor , teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree . As a result , university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities , and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications . Secondly , the job market is becoming increasingly competitive , and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company . Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete", "It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future . Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen , I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved . There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money . Firstly , if a language is only spoken by a small number of people , expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it , and the state will have to pay for facilities , teachers and marketing . This money might be better spent on other public services . Secondly , it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language . Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group . Despite the above arguments , I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken . A language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it . If a language disappears , a whole way of life will disappear with it , and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting . By spending money to protect minority languages , governments can also preserve traditions , customs and behaviours that are part of a country\u2019s history", "In today\u2019s life , there is a wide range of people who work under flexible environment , while others are exposed to stressful conditions . It is unadvisable to proceed with any job , if the employer is not taking into account the vital paths required in convincing their employees to continue their jobs properly . In this essay , I am going to address the contributing factors to job satisfaction which are in terms of working hours , salaries and graduates . It has been essential to understand individuals\u2019 commitments to exclude this particular fellow from 9 to 5 working hours . For example , some people cannot be punctual at work because they have disabled daughters or sons , who could not be able to travel to school independently . Therefore , it is important to change the original time schedule to give these people flexibility . So this type of help would give them more job contentment . The fact that could not be denied and encourage the employee remarkably is the reliable salaries in addition to promotions to the highly achievable workers . For example , if a worker in a factory is able to fix a broken down one of the machines , it is illogical not to reward this worker for his great help to the factory . Therefore , if we award this worker , he will be grateful and more confident to his job . Awarding and reasonable salaries are essential elements to job satisfaction . It is essential to accommodate the right person at work on the right place according to their degree or certificate . If an individual has graduated as an accountant , it is unrealistic to work a job as a carpenter . One of the consequences of that is the worker is not going to like his job because there is no sensible relationship between this job and his main occupation", "In times of high unemployment , employers need to do very little to encourage their staff to work hard , but when job vacancies are scarced , they have to find effective ways of rewarding their staff to stop them from going elsewhere . One obvious way of doing this is to offer extra money to employees who are seen to be working exceptionally hard and this is done in companies with a product to sell . For example , real estate agents or department stores can offer a simple commission on all sales . This style of management favors people who can demonstrate their contribution through sales figures , but does not take into account the work done by people behind the scenes who little contact with the public . A better approach is for management to offer a bonus to all the staff at the end of year if the profits are healthy . This , however , does not allow management to target individuals who have genuinely worked harder than others . Another possibility is to identify excellent staff through incentive schemes such as \u2018Employee of the Month\u2019 or \u2018Worker of the Week\u2019 to make people feel recognized . Such people are usually singled out with the help of clients . Hotels , restaurants and tour operators may also allow staff to accept tips offered by clients who are pleased with the service . However , tipping is a highly unreliable source of money and does not favor everyone . Basically , employees want to be recognized for their contribution - whether through receiving more money or simply some encouraging words . They also need to feel that their contribution to the whole organization is worthwhile", "In comparison with even the recent past , the choice of leisure activities on offer today is vast , so it is reasonable to find that some of these activities reflect the trends and fads of the day . People have far more money and time than before to pursue their interests but the ever-increasing number of activities does not automatically guarantee continuity . In fact , new hobbies come and go . For example , sports such as rollerblading lose their fascination after a few months . Similarly , although snowboarding has taken over from traditional skiing , it is doubtful whether its popularity will last . Other things like electronic games go out of date almost as soon as you have bought them because the manufacturers promote the fact that only the latest version is worth having . And so ensure continued sales . On the other hand , not everyone is a victim of fashion in this way and people of all ages and backgrounds may take up hobbies for social reasons . Traditional hobbies range from participation in active sports like tennis to old favorites such as chess and stamp collecting , and these continue to be popular . By joining a club , people can make friends and feel part of a group with whom they can share a common interest and leisure time . Where sport is concerned , most people know what they like and participate out of love of the game , rather than because it is currently fashionable", "Over the past 30 years , many countries have sent most of their income repaying the interest on foreign debts . Many people consider the initial loans responsible for these debts to be more beneficial to the lender than to the borrower . I agree with this view . In the past , most developing countries were short of ready funds to build the infrastructure necessary for development . Therefore , foreign countries were asked to provide loans for projects to help the countries become self-reliant . However , this money was often used to make quick profits for developers or to line the pockets of corrupt officials . Once the money is used , the problem of repayment begins . Since the 1970s many developing countries have found that they cannot pay back the loans or even the interest is accumulated on the loans . Consequently , the countries have borrowed more money to pay back the interest . This gave Western countries the power to dictate government policy through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . These financial institutions are only interested in balance sheets . Therefore , nations have been forced to adopt policies which do nothing to develop their resources or improve the lives of the local people . Countries that get caught in this debt spiral have no chance of paying back the initial money borrowed , while the banks making the loans make two or three times the money lent after the interest payments are taken into account . As most donor countries have already been repaid , both in terms of money and in term of economic interest , it is morally right for developing countries to refuse to pay back foreign loans", "Nowadays , obesity has become one of the outstanding problems in some countries especially in developed and developing ones in addition to the fact that the majority of people do not have a healthy body . In this modern world , the individual\u2019s activities are so limited . It is obviously clear that the technology brings some benefits to the society like the availability of doing business from home via the Internet or utilizing vacuum cleaners or dishwashers which cause people to become so lazy . In this case , the lack of physical movements leads to having excess weight . Another reason for gaining extra weights could be the consumption of unhealthy foods , especially inorganic fruits and vegetables which are grown by harmful chemical fertilizers and artificial substances such as pesticides or substances used in order to boost the harvest process . These seemingly technological achievements can seriously harm humans\u2019 health . To halt these irrecoverable influences or reduce the detrimental effects on our body , some pragmatic measures must be taken . Doctors believe that exercise is one of the best solutions to decreasing obesity and being healthy . By doing exercises just one hour per day , we will be able to improve our lifestyle remarkably . Another step towards health could be to eat nutrient-rich foods instead of fast foods . Vegetables and fruits help our body to have better metabolism . It is proved that digesting these kinds of foods is simpler for the digestive system of our body than animals\u2019 meat", "For overseas students and expatriates , homesickness has always been common . I believe that most people who travel away from home for any length of time will feel homesick at the beginning because missing their own home and country is a natural reaction . However , I think it becomes less of a problem as people adapt to the new environment and start to enjoy new relationships and experiences . Today many young people study abroad and for them it is probably their first time away from family , friends and everything that is familiar . The country they have moved to may have completely different culture and language , so they need to adjust to this and learn how to communicate in the ways . This can be very tiring , but until they can do so , they will feel out of place and unable to form new relationships . Professionals who have moved abroad for work may have left older parents behind , or even young children . For them the separation can be worse because they feel so far from the people they feel responsible for . I personally think that people should try and prepare themselves for study or work abroad . They need to learn the new language and try to be as adaptable and independent as they can . At the same time , however , they need to set up ways of communication quickly and easily with people back home , by using emails for instance , so that they know what is happening there and do not need to worry . If people are aware of the problems , they can do a lot to reduce their homesickness and make their stay abroad a positive , exciting experience . To conclude , the initial problem of getting oneself to fit in the new environment is what cause homesickness among people who live far away from their home country", "It is true to say that fossil fuels are still our main source of energy today , and as more countries develop their industries and their economies , the scale of their use continues to grow . However , we are now well aware of the consequences of relying on this energy source for our natural environment . Global warming and the damage to the protective ozone layer are caused by carbon dioxide and other by-products of fossil fuels . So I certainly agree that these problems are global rather than national ones . They threaten our whole planet and no action by a single country could solve them . Furthermore , these problems are urgent as nobody knows when our natural world will be so damaged that it will no longer be able to support us . While some countries already use safer alternative energy sources , such as wind , water or solar power , it seems that there has not been sufficient investment in developing the technology to make such alternative viable for all . So it should definitely be a global priority to invest in such research and development . Obviously , there are other global priorities that we also need to address , such as poverty and diseases . But while it may be the case that these problems are just as important as the energy problem , there is a sense that time is ticking away for our planet and any solutions to the energy issue will take some time to achieve", "From the evidence of developing countries all over the world , it seems inevitable that economic growth is generated in the business and industrial centers of the major cities . As a result , urban citizens have access to jobs and facilities that improve their living standards considerably . However , it is usually the case that these are not equally enjoyed by people in the countryside and this generates several problems for the countries concerned . First of all , people from the countryside will try to move to the cities to get more employment opportunities and better access to facilities available there . However , this increase in the urban population puts great pressure on housing and services , and leads to the creation of massive slum areas where conditions may be lower than standards in the rural villages which are often left under-populated . This can impact food production and can have severe affects for people in both urban and rural areas . Finally , as a country\u2019s economy develops , there may be an increasing sense of inequality as the towns get richer and the villages get poorer , and this may lead to more crime and even civil unrest . The key to reducing these problems seems to lie in improving the standard of living and the facilities available in the countryside . Perhaps incentives can be offered to factories and companies to relocate; road and rail networks can be built to make such relocation possible; doctors and teachers could be required to spend part of their professional lives in rural areas . In conclusion , discrepancies in economic growth can cause pressures on the overall living standards and many production activities", "Generally , music is considered to be one of the most popular and ancient modes of human expression . It features largely in all histories and all cultures and indeed has been one of the main ways of passing on cultural traditions to new generations . Many people view music as a positive influence for societies . They also believe that the influence on individuals is wholly beneficial as it is a long-established way of communicating and helping us to understand the whole range of human emotions and experience in a more spiritual language than words can represent . However , there are different kinds of music and the qualities of classical music traditions are not necessarily part of the music many people experience today . In the modern world , there is a huge music industry that sells piped music to supermarkets and advertisers . We are also constantly exposed to loud modern music from people\u2019s CD players , iPods or car radios . So the view of music today as a kind of noise pollution produced by money-driven people , is also a common and negative one , but it is difficult to think of a world without music . Certainly , there is bad music that may have negative influences , particularly on the young . But people\u2019s taste in music tends to change as they get older , and it would be difficult to find someone who had no positive musical associations at all", "I would agree that young people today play a bigger role in society than their parents\u2019 or grandparents\u2019 generation did . This is mainly due to the larger social and technological changes that have increased the gap between the generations . Young people today are generally better educated , and because they have been trained from a young age to use computer technology , they have Internet access to information in a way that was unimaginable for earlier generations . This means that they are probably better informed than their parents\u2019 grandparents were at their age , and their hi-tech skills give them confidence in dealing with the very rapid changes in technology that are so uncomfortable for older people . In addition , younger people are often the most affected by globalization . They follow fashions in clothes , music and social habits that are common among young people throughout the world . So they have become powerful consumers who influence big global markets today . As a result of these developments , relationships with older people are often difficult . Teachers and parents are treated with less respect , and experience is undervalued because young people think they know everything , or at least can learn about everything from the Internet . In many cultures , this has led to a decline in school discipline , an increase in family breakdowns and even serious social problems . However , the current generation gap is the responsibility of both younger and older generations", "In every country , there are fashions among students about which subjects are the best to the study at university . Sometimes the popularity of a subject is determined by how much money a graduate could subsequently earn in that field . Or subjects that are perceived as relatively \u2018easy\u2019 may also become popular , in spite of later difficulties of finding appropriate employment . It is up to governments to give incentives to students to choose subjects that match the needs of their society . Obviously one way to do this would be for the government to pay the fees of those choosing such subjects . The advantage would certainly be that higher number of students would enroll and would later fill the employment gaps . However , the disadvantages of such a policy would be considerable . For example , the students attracted by the funding may not have any real interest in or aptitude for that subject . Such students may drop out before graduation or after working only a short time in a related job . Furthermore , funding one group of students but not other would penalize those with a genuine interest and ability for another field . Such discrimination would certainly affect the whole of higher education of the country , and students would develop very negative attitudes towards going to university altogether . This would be very counter-productive for any country . In conclusion , I think there are many other incentives for students that could be considered , such as making courses more interesting to take , or the job rewards greater after graduation", "It is certainly true that today traffic in cities throughout the world has become a major problem . This is obvious from the number of vehicles on our roads and the amount of pollution they cause . Probably the traffic problem is due to people commuting for work , study and other purposes and this is evident in the rush hours . It is also true that today such daily commuting is not always necessary because people can do these things from home , we can see this in the options Information Technology gives us today . For instance , on-line work , distance learning and shopping facilities are all available via the internet . However , even if everyone had access to the technology and the opportunity to work from home , it is unrealistic to think that everyone would want to . Even though the technology for working , studying or shopping on-line makes this option a possibility , it would mean people had less freedom of choice and less social contact in their lives . This would have a large impact on society as a whole . So , in conclusion , I think that while this practice could reduce the traffic problems in our cities , it is most unlikely to be an acceptable solution . In terms of other solutions , perhaps we need to think more carefully about facilitating public transport and limiting private cars in our city centers", "It is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people . Technology has affected relationships in various ways , and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects . Technology has had an impact on relationships in business , education and social life . Firstly , telephones and the Internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other . Secondly , services like Skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers . For example , a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country . Finally , many people use social networks , like Facebook , to make new friends and find people who share common interests , and can they interact through their computers rather than face to face . On the one hand , these developments can be extremely positive . Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams . Nowadays , interactions via email , phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings , and many of us benefit from these interactions , either in work or social contexts . On the other hand , the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction . For example , many young people choose to make friends online rather than bonding with their peers in the real world , and these \u2018virtual\u2019 relationships are a poor a substitute for real friendships", "Some hobbies are relatively easy , while others present more of a challenge . Personally , I believe that both types of hobby can be fun , and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable . On the one hand , many people enjoy easy hobbies . One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming . This hobby requires very little equipment , it is simple to learn , and it is inexpensive . I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child , and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience . Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography . In my opinion , anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera . Despite being straightforward , taking photos is a satisfying activity . On the other hand , difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting . If an activity is more challenging , we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully . For example , film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise . In my case , it took me around two years before I became competent at this activity , but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started . I believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater", "Many young people work on a voluntary basis , and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole . However , I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work . Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies , without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time . School is just as demanding as a full-time job , and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day . When young people do have some free time , we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities . They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies . At the same time , I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work . In fact , I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will . Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people , who would feel that they were being used , and parents , who would not want to be told how to raise their children . Currently , nobody is forced to volunteer , and this is surely the best system", "It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world . Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons , and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern , international music . Music is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives . As children , we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language , or simply as a form of enjoyment . Children delight in singing with others , and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants , regardless of their age . Later in life , people\u2019s musical preferences develop , and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories . Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot . In short , it is difficult to imagine life without it . In my opinion , traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular . International pop music is often catchy and fun , but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people . Traditional music , by contrast , expresses the culture , customs and history of a country . Traditional styles , such as jazz , can connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity . It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared", "Many people , and children in particular , enjoy playing computer games . While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user , I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact . On the one hand , video games can be both entertaining and educational . Users , or gamers , are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes . From an educational perspective , these games encourage imagination and creativity , as well as concentration , logical thinking and problem solving , all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context . Furthermore , it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users\u2019 motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks , such as flying a plane . However , I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks . Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores , new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing . Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends . This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school , when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console . The rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction . In conclusion , it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits . In the developed world , average life expectancy is increasing . What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations . It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before . Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend , societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems . As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older , several related problems can be anticipated . The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension . The proportion of younger , working adults will be smaller , and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population . In other words , an aging population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults . Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare , and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives . There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above . Firstly , a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults , perhaps from 65 to 70 . Nowadays , people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life . A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes . Finally , money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare , accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens", "It is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use . While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong , I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines . On the one hand , there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation . To use a common example of this practice , laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured . Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma , and that the lives of all creatures should be respected . They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused , and that scientists should use alternative methods of research . On the other hand , reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available . Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved . They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation . Personally , I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products , and I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned", "People have different views about the funding of creative artists . While some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists , I believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources . Some art projects definitely require help from the state . In the UK , there are many works of art in public spaces , such as streets or squares in city centres . In Liverpool , for example , there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city , which has been redeveloped recently . These artworks represent culture , heritage and history . They serve to educate people about the city , and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists . Governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art , because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive . On the other hand , I can understand the arguments against government funding for art . The main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns . For example , state budgets need to be spent on education , healthcare , infrastructure and security , among other areas . These public services are vital for a country to function properly , whereas the work of creative artists , even in public places , is a luxury . Another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional , and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work", "It is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments . I completely disagree with this idea . The argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going , which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system . However , I believe this to be a very shortsighted view . Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services , including food , souvenirs , accommodation and travel . The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them . If travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation , they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday . To take the UK as an example , the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul\u2019s Cathedral . These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality , and this helps to promote the nation\u2019s cultural heritage . If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices , there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings", "People have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays . In my view , modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past . There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now . Firstly , life is more complex and difficult , especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically . For example , young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house . Property prices are higher than ever , and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage . Secondly , people seem to be more ambitious nowadays , and they want a better quality of life for their families . This means that both parents usually need to work full-time , and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care . However , I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days . In most countries , families are becoming smaller and more dispersed , which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to . We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns . For example , many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university , and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone . Another factor in this growing independence is technology , which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world", "Many people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered . Personally , I disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career , because I believe that other factors are equally important . On the one hand , I agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs . For example , we all need money to pay for housing , food , bills , health care , and education . Most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life . If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors , they might find it difficult to support themselves . Artists and musicians , for instance , are known for choosing a career path that they love , but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family . Nevertheless , I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs . Firstly , personal relationships work environment are extremely important when choosing a job . Having a good manager or friendly colleagues , for example , can make a huge difference to workers\u2019 levels of happiness and general quality of life . Secondly , many people\u2019s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements , the skills they learn , and the position they reach , rather than the money they earn . Finally , some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society", "It is true that some celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyles rather than for the work they do . While I agree that these celebrities set a bad example for children , I believe that other famous people act as positive role models . On the one hand , many people do achieve fame without really working for it . They may have inherited money from parents , married a famous or wealthy person , or they may have appeared in gossip magazines or on a reality TV programme . A good example would be Paris Hilton , who is rich and famous for the wrong reasons . She spends her time attending parties and nightclubs , and her behaviour promotes the idea that appearance , glamour and media profile are more important than hard work and good character . The message to young people is that success can be achieved easily , and that school work is not necessary . On the other hand , there are at least as many celebrities whose accomplishments make them excellent role models for young people . Actors , musicians and sports stars become famous idols because they have worked hard and applied themselves to develop real skills and abilities . They demonstrate great effort , determination and ambition , which is required for someone who wants to be truly successful in their chosen field . An example is the actor and martial artist Jackie Chan , who has become world famous through years of practice and hard work . This kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance", "Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes . Personally , I completely disagree with this view . For a variety of reasons , it would be wrong to reduce taxes for families who pay for private education . Firstly , it would be difficult to calculate the correct amount of tax reduction for these families , and staff would be required to manage this complex process . Secondly , we all pay a certain amount of tax for public services that we may not use . For example , most people are fortunate enough not to have to call the police or fire brigade at any time in their lives , but they would not expect a tax reduction for this . Finally , if wealthy families were given a tax discount for sending their children to private schools , we might have a situation where poorer people pay higher taxes than the rich . In my opinion , we should all be happy to pay our share of the money that supports public schools . It is beneficial for all members of society to have a high quality education system with equal opportunities for all young people . This will result in a well-educated workforce , and in turn a more productive and prosperous nation . Parents of children in private schools may also see the advantages of this in their own lives . For example , a company owner will need well qualified and competent staff , and a well-funded education system can provide such employees", "Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them . I completely disagree with this point of view . In my opinion , it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21st century . I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans , and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species . Furthermore , there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out . We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world\u2019s population . There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals , and this should be our aim . I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources . It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals , and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival . For example , rainforests produce oxygen , absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the Earth\u2019s climate . If we destroyed these areas , the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation . By protecting wild animals and their habitats , we maintain the natural balance of all life on Earth", "It is true that men are increasingly likely to take on the role of a househusband , while more women than ever are the breadwinners in their families . There could be several reasons for this , and I consider it to be a very positive trend . In recent years , parents have had to adapt to various changes in our societies . Equal rights movements have made great progress , and it has become normal for women to gain qualifications and pursue a career . It has also become socially acceptable for men to stay at home and look after their children . At the same time , the rising cost of living has meant that both marriage partners usually need to work and save money before starting a family . Therefore , when couples have children , they may decide who works and who stays at home depending on the personal preference of each partner , or based on which partner earns more money . In my view , the changes described above should be seen as progress . We should be happy to live in a society in which men and women have equal opportunities , and in which women are not put under pressure to sacrifice their careers . Equally , it seems only fair that men should be free to leave their jobs in order to assume childcare responsibilities if this is what they wish to do . Couples should be left to make their own decisions about which parental role each partner takes , according to their particular circumstances and needs", "People have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer . In my view , both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits . On the one hand , strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely . Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent , meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence . There are various types of driving penalty , such as small fines , licence suspension , driver awareness courses , and even prison sentences . The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences . As a result , we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert , and that they follow the rules more carefully . On the other hand , I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that do not punish drivers . Firstly , it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive , and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test . Secondly , more attention could be paid to safe road design . For example , signs can be used to warn people , speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic , and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly . Finally , governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport , which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car", "Should governments give more financial support to local film industries? It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films . There could be several reasons why this is the case , and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidising the industry . There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries . Firstly , the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action , special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations . Hollywood blockbusters like \u2018Avatar\u2019 or the James Bond films are examples of such productions , and their global appeal is undeniable . Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses , and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors . The poor quality , low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison . In my view , governments should support local film industries financially . In every country , there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves . To compete with big-budget productions from overseas , these people need money to pay for film crews , actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films . If governments did help with these costs , they would see an increase in employment in the film industry , income from film sales , and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers . New Zealand , for example , has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films , which were partly funded by government subsidies", "It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people . While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated , I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten . On the one hand , many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people . In the past , for example , people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life , but today\u2019s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers . At the same time , the \u2018rules\u2019 around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry . But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles . The traditional roles of men and women , as breadwinners and housewives , are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people . On the other hand , some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world . For example , older generations attach great importance to working hard , doing one\u2019s best , and taking pride in one\u2019s work , and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today\u2019s competitive job market . Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners . In our globalised world , young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds , and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect . Finally , I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 sense of community and neighbourliness", "There are clear arguments for banning smoking , based largely on health , but there is perhaps a stronger case to be made for maintaining the current situation , as will now be explained . The most important factor for keeping smoking legal is that the decision to smoke is not something that should be controlled by the government , but by the individuals . If a person decides to smoke , they do so of their own free will and this should be respected , as it is the government's role to advise against harmful practices , but ultimately not to make decisions for its citizens . The other reason for allowing smoking is that by making laws against it is more likely to result in the sale of tobacco moving to the black market , and consequently increasing the level of associated crime . There will still be people who cannot overcome their addiction , and will search for any means available to access cigarettes . A clear example of this reaction can be seen in the illegal sale of other drugs such as cocaine and marijuana . Obviously , there is the fact that smoking is known to have adverse health effects on both the smoker and those around them who are affecting by passive smoking . Yet there are other lifestyle choices that also have a negative impact , such as fast food and alcohol , and banning these items would restrict the choice available to the consumers . In conclusion , the decision to ban smoking , although having some advantages , would be more likely to have an overall negative effect", "Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience . There has long been an argument against maintaining zoos in which animals are kept away from their natural habitat , and there is strong evidence to suggest that technology has developed to a point where such institutions are no longer needed , as will now be argued . Traditionally , the principal argument voiced by those who wish to retain zoos was that it allowed children and adults to see animals which they more than likely would not have had a chance to do if this had required visiting the creature's natural environment . Yet there are now online videos and websites where these animals can be seen in high definition , therefore no longer needing to go to enclosures to see the animals . This is clearly evident by the declining number of visitors in recent years . In addition , there are many cases in which animals held in captivity are not well cared for and are used solely to exploit them for profit . In some rare cases , the animals can suffer from neglect or malnutrition , and rather than being kept healthy are simply replaced when they are no longer of any value . Granted , there are situations in which endangered species are protected and their numbers allowed to rebuild by housing them in the security of a zoo . However , in most cases the same effect is better achieved by using more open plan wildlife parks rather than traditional caged enclosures", "With an increasing world population and subsequent environmental concerns , it is important to dispose of trash in an eco-friendly manner , yet there are a significant number of places around the world that fail to do so . There are a number of reasons that mean that recycling is not done as effectively as it could , the primary problem being the attitude of the general public . Lethargy or lack of knowledge leads people to throw all of their rubbish into one place , meaning that material that could have been sorted and reused is buried in landfills . In the UK , for example , over 20 million tonnes of waste is buried whilst less than 1 percent of that amount is actively recycled . There is also the matter of availability , as there are situations in which recycling facilities are either extremely limited or nonexistent . In order to combat these issues , the first step would be educating the general public about the facts of waste disposal and recycling , perhaps even enforcing participation by levying a fine against those who do not separate their rubbish into different types . Hand in hand with this , making recycling centres more available would also help , or perhaps adopting a system used in some Asian countries where households are given a number of different containers into which to sort their rubbish for collection . Overall , it seems that a change of attitude is needed as well as more resources to manage different recyclable materials", "Compulsory retirement is common in many countries when members of the workforce reach 65 or 70 , and this has both advantages and downsides , as will now be considered . The main advantage of requiring people to leave their job at a certain age is that it provides opportunities for younger members of staff to join the workforce , often meaning that companies benefit from having lower wages to pay for the new recruits and also having younger , potentially more dynamic employees . This in turn could well give the company the required boost to continue being profitable . Another advantage is that some older people may choose to keep working more out of habit than enjoyment , and therefore a mandatory retirement may encourage them to enjoy their life more , having the free time to engage in hobbies and interests such as gardening , which they may not have previously had time for up to that point . Yet there are significant disadvantages in forced retirement . Older staff members often have more experience , and may have no desire to leave their job . Requiring them to leave could mean a skill shortage for the company as well as a feeling of discontent from the employee . Added to that is the rising number of older people and the subsequent drain on resources if they are not working; if there are more elderly people on pensions or other benefits , the increased tax burden falls on the younger generation", "In many countries , pupils are required to wear uniforms when attending school , and I believe this is something that should be enforced for the following reasons . Primarily , students , especially those in their teenagers years , are under pressure both academically and socially; insisting on a standardised uniform within the school alleviates some of this as it means that the student does not have to worry about whether their peers think that they are dressed well or in the latest fashions . This has the added advantage for those from lower income families who may simply not be able to afford the clothes worn by those from more affluent families . Not only does it remove the social pressure , but wearing a school uniform also has a psychological advantage , as the student is dressed in the mode of attire used for study . Much like wearing a suit and tie may signal going to work for many people , wearing a school uniform prepares the child for the day of learning . However , this perhaps works best for younger students . By age 16 or 17 , it may be appropriate for the student to wear more casual clothing when they reach their later teens , as the idea of 'conforming' by wearing a uniform could discourage the student from pursuing further education and this is often the time in which young adults are looking to establish their own clear identity . It is at this point that it may be more productive to allow more relaxed clothing such as jeans", "Traditionally , academic achievements are often regarded as an indispensable factor for success . However , there are a handful of individuals hold the belief that the art of social interaction also shares equal importance in determining one\u2019s success in life . My sentiment is on par with this viewpoint , and some of my good grounds will be presented in the essay below . It is conspicuous that academic qualifications are of great significance when comes to seeking employment . Undoubtedly , academic qualifications reflect a person\u2019s educational background and personal experiences . This usually lays a foundation for an overall evaluation of any candidate . Based on what is written and listed in those certificates and degrees , recruiters would select the most appropriate one to join their organizations . In other words , educational achievements can exert a tremendous impact on the judgment of the employers who are looking for potential white-collar workers . Simultaneously , it cannot be denied that the art of social interaction plays a pivotal role in one\u2019s success as well . In actual fact , in this day and age , having a high level of social skills is considered to be a strength in the workplace . This is due to the fact that managers often put an emphasis on the ability of coordination , cooperation , and communication to enhance efficiency . A salient example of this is the solidarity of the staff within an office , which would foster a positive attitude towards work and a sense of community , leading to a sense of self-satisfaction from their job . To conclude , in a society in which people are becoming increasingly interdependent , one cannot succeed with mere qualifications", "In many major metropolitan areas , land is set aside for all members of the public to enjoy , and this is something that should remain as will now be discussed . The main reason in support of retaining parkland is that it provides a communal area for people who may otherwise live in apartments or small houses without access to a garden . It has been well documented that time spent outdoors has clear health benefits , not only for exercise and fresh air , but also for mental health . Another reason is that increasing populations in urban areas has a number of negative subsidiary effects , such as the pressure on sanitation and clean water supplies . Replacing parks with more housing will only further compound this problem . In Mexico City , for example , the population is so dense that in many areas , delivery of fresh water supplies is under extreme pressure . On a related note , there is also an environmental advantage in having parkland , as it is a source of oxygen production which may otherwise be lacking in urban areas . Admittedly , the level of the population relocating to urban areas in increasing for employment reasons as there are often more jobs available , and for this to be possible , additional land will need to be used for housing and this needs to be sourced near the place of work to avoid excess travel . However , it is arguable that it would be better to create larger suburbs than overcrowd centre of cities", "It has become common not to try to extend the life of items but rather to purchase replacements , and this can be attributed to a number of social changes , as will now be presented along with some thoughts on how this attitude can be altered . Of the many reasons why society in general opts not to repair items , perhaps the most influential is changes in technology . Modernised production methods allow goods to be mass produced at a lower cost , but often at the expense of quality; this means that although they may not have the durability of handmade items , they are cheaper and thus can be replaced . In addition , evolutions in technology are now rapid , and the impulse to own the latest gadget encourages purchasers to continually buy new items . A clear indication of this is mobile phones , where in the last decade new features and abilities are released constantly . To address this , there are a number of potential approaches . One is that governments could raise the level of tax on brand new items whilst lowering the taxation on repair shops , therefore supporting those who are happy with their existing technology and penalising those who constantly race to acquire the very latest model . In turn , this would encourage the companies producing such items to build them in a way that new developments can be incorporated into it , rather than requiring it to be disposed of", "Increasing globalisation has made it almost essential for many people to learn more than their native tongue so they can converse with people from other countries , and there are strong arguments to be made in support of acquiring second or even third languages as a young child , as will now be considered . Perhaps the most persuasive reason is that children have a far better ability to learn when young compared to later on in life . Information is more readily absorbed and put into practice , and younger children are able to retain what they are taught . It has also been proven that when learning a language at a young age , a child is able to better pronounce words or sounds that may be absent in their own language . In addition , younger children also have fewer external concerns to contend with . To illustrate , a parent with a job , bills and the responsibilities of looking after their children will be less able to focus on learning a new language compared to a child who is simply attending school . The younger the better , as this also means that they are not yet overwhelmed with homework and other preoccupations common to students in their early and mid teens . Granted , there is an argument that attempting to learn an additional language at an early age may result in the child confusing the primary and secondary language , meaning they may not have a good a grasp of their home language as other children . However , this can be negated by having specific and separate classes for each language , improving skills in both", "There are many important life skills such as the ability to operate a vehicle that are developed both through childhood and early adulthood , but teaching these should not necessarily be left to education departments , as will now be argued . The principal provider of knowledge to a child should be the parent , and although more academic subjects such as science and languages should be left to professionals , abilities like driving and swimming are best taught by parents , at least initially . If the parent feels they are not suited to the task , or the law in that country does not allow parents to teach their children to drive , then a driving instructor should be sought , not a school . In addition , it could be argued that although operating a car is a useful skill , it is not essential and should be something that each individual decides rather than being a compulsory part of their education . Other subjects which provide a more rounded education should be emphasised , as this will allow the student to be able to find a position of employment more easily once they graduate from school or further studies . However , an argument could be made that the ability to drive could be required in an emergency situation , and therefore should be taught . Yet situations where this would actually be required would be rare , and less valuable than other skills such as first aid", "There are a number of factors which explain the rising tendency for people to take trips overseas for pleasure , and this has both advantages and disadvantages as will now be discussed . Innovations in technology have made overseas travel not only faster , but also more accessible for those on a limited budget , meaning that in some cases a family can holiday in a different country with less inconvenience and a better price than staying in their home country . A flight from the UK to Spain , for example , can be accomplished in less time than it takes to get from one side of England to the other . One of the clearest advantages here is that it gives people the opportunity to experience different cultures and customs , giving a broader perspective of the world . By visiting other countries , people will understand more about other cultures , and can learn to appreciate the cultural differences that exist . There are also benefits for the holiday itself , as many people tend to holiday in destinations that have better weather . However , there are disadvantages for the country , as citizens are spending their money overseas rather than in the domestic market . However , this is negated by the fact that although people leave their own country for a holiday , other people visit their country for the same reason . In New Zealand , for example , money spent overseas by people leaving the country is replaced by those who visit the country for their holiday", "The payment of a benefit for those who are out of work is a sensitive issue with strong opinions for and against . This essay will now examine both sides of the argument and present a final conclusion . Those in favour of this financial support argue that in some cases , it is not the fault of the unemployed person , and that the assistance is needed for them to survive while they continue to look for work . Without this , there is the potential concern that crime would increase due to a lack of alternatives . To illustrate , if a parent with dependent children could not find work and had no other help , they would have little option but to resort to theft to prevent their children from going hungry . On the other hand , there are those that argue that paying someone who does not work simply encourages people to remain unemployed , especially when the alternative could be a relatively low paid job . There are situations where people are simply not interested in finding a position of employment as it offers very little additional money compared to doing nothing at home and receiving free handouts . This situation could escalate as people who are on a low income may resent paying a portion of their tax payments to support those who make little or no effort to find employment . Considering both points of view , it seems that a compromise may be the best solution . Payment of the unemployment benefit should be limited to a short period of time , after which the amount received should be progressively reduced", "Do you agree or disagree? It is not uncommon these days for younger people to spend an hour or more a day online , and although this does detract from time spent taking to family members , it is not necessarily affecting their social development as will now be discussed . The primary reason to disagree with the statement is that a considerable amount of time that youngsters are on the internet is actually spent on social networking sites such as Facebook . As these sites are specifically designed for social purposes , the argument that social skills are declining would appear to be invalid . It is only when the time online is spent playing single player games or generally surfing for entertainment without interacting with others online that this could be considered unsociable . In addition , an increasing dependence on the Internet for a broad range of tasks from completing homework and studies to checking bank balances and searching for employment means that being online is often simply an alternative manner of working or completing necessary chores , and should not be considered related to social skills at all . Admittedly , if too much time is spent online playing games or looking at websites , then there is the potential for surfers to become less able to interact with people directly . However , this can be negated by ensuring that time online is limited to a reasonable amount , and can even be controlled by using technology that actively records the amount of time online", "Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience . In many traditional cultures , members of the same family will live together from childhood to old age . In many cases , older family members living at home is a trend which has both positive and negative aspects . A significant point in favour of this is that it provides a good support network for parents , both of whom may work outside of the home . Having grandparents on hand to look after the children can potentially provide a more stable environment as the child will have a familiar face at home until the parents have finished working . The influence of the grandparents extends beyond simple babysitting , however . They are able to provide a source of advice and knowledge that can greatly benefit all members of the family on a range of subjects , especially for when there are new born babies in the home as this can be a stressful time for new parents . There are , of course , also disadvantages in having older people at home . There is the issue of space , as the family home may not be big enough to accommodate everyone comfortably . There is also the issue of deciding which members of the family should live together , as both the husband and wife may both have living parents . To conclude , there are clear positives and negatives to having older members of the family living in the same house", "There is a rising tendency for people of all ages to have surgery to improve their appearance , although there are a number of arguments against this as will now be examined . The main reason that such procedures should be discouraged is that people should be more confident in themselves , and not be swayed by images in the media . People are constantly bombarded with pictures of people looking glamorous , but these photos have often been digitally altered for the best effect . Many young people , however , suffer from low self- esteem and feel that through operations they could look like the celebrities they see . Another argument against cosmetic procedures is that this diverts resources from more necessary surgeries , which in turn causes longer delays for those in desperate need . Even though such procedures may be done privately , it still requires the attendance of medical staff that would perhaps otherwise be available to the public health system . This can be seen in the waiting lists in the UK , for example , where it can take several months or longer to have a hip replacement operation . However , there are situations when cosmetic surgery can vastly improve the patient's quality of life , such as those who have suffered significant burns or other disfigurements . There are many examples of people for whom surgical work has allowed them to rebuild their life in ways which would have been exceptionally difficult or impossible otherwise", "Meals made in an old fashion are not as common these days for a number of different reasons , as will now be explained . The primary factor is that more modern variants of traditional dishes are often less time consuming to prepare . It is not uncommon for both parents to work outside of the home , meaning that there is less opportunity for people to spend the hours required in shopping , preparing and cooking , so opting for a quick and easy meal is often preferred . Another significant cause for this decline is that the skills that in previous generations were handed down from parents to children are no longer considered as valuable , and as such , many younger people simply lack the required knowledge . Already many traditional skills such as bread making are no longer passed on , and this is illustrated in the rising consumption of convenience food among younger people . A third contributor to the fall in traditional food preparation is also related to the modern global nature of most societies . Historically , traditional meals were common because the required ingredients were all that was available locally . These days , however , most large cities have shops and restaurants with food from all over the globe . A clear example of this influence is in the United Kingdom , where the most popular takeaway food is Indian cuisine", "Increasing urban populations have led to a corresponding increase in the number of vehicles on the road , resulting in rising congestion in city centres . There are a number of potential solutions to the problem , as will now be discussed . Perhaps the first step to take would be to improve the availability of public transport and install bus lanes throughout the city . Whilst this would , in the short term , increase the pressure on the roads , it is likely to result in more people using public transport and leaving their vehicles at home . One way of encouraging people to adopt buses and trains is to lower the price and expand the timetable . Following that , local councils or the government could make it more difficult for car drivers to use their car by either charging a levy or only allowing certain vehicles in city areas on certain days . A similar system has been running in London for some time , and has resulted in fewer vehicles on the roads . An alternative idea , one which is more extreme than levies and selective use , is to simply prevent private passenger vehicles from entering the city at all . By having only public transport options , there would be no problem with congestion and would allow for more pedestrian areas in the metropolitan areas", "When considering tertiary level education , there is a school of thought that believes that studying more practical topics such as commerce , physics or biology is more valuable to society than spending time focussed on novels and other literary subjects . However , this argument is flawed for a number of reasons as will now be presented . Although certain fields of study lead more directly into a position of employment , university education is valuable not only for the education learned but also as an indication that the person has the ability to learn , and as such it is irrelevant whether it is a career based course of study or something more intangible , like the arts . It suggests to potential employers that person can learn new skills , and this is often as important as what is already known . Moreover , those that complete an arts related degree could potentially go on to be writers , poets or playwrights , for example , and thus contribute to society in a cultural form rather than financially or technologically . The opinion that the writer is of less worth than the scientist is very biased , especially when it comes to a contribution to society . Admittedly , there is the point that science and business related education can financially benefit a country , whereas art and literature does not offer the same value economically . However , a country's wealth is not calculated in financial terms alone", "Of the number of undergraduates that begin a course of tertiary study , there is a percentage of those that do not finish the course , but the argument that they should therefore be financially penalised is riddled with potential problems . It needs to be considered first of all what motivated the student to leave their studies before they have graduated . If the decision was made due to financial constraints , then clearly adding an additional fine is simply adding to the pressure . For example , there are many older people who decide to go back to university but may already have a mortgage and dependent children , and may consequently find that their income is insufficient to cover their needs . Moreover , rather than attempting to make the student pay , it might be better to consider whether the student was actually given sufficient support during their studies . There are situations where the student may feel that they are not following the course and are unable complete the required assignments , and therefore leave the course . Retention rates may be improved if there were personal tutors on hand to offer advice to those students who are losing confidence in their ability to remain on the course . On the other hand , there is an argument that the risk of a penalty would dissuade people from starting courses that they were not particularly motivated to complete in the first place", "Advancements in technology have made a significant difference to the way in which people are able to learn , and though this is mostly beneficial , there are also some negative aspects that will also be considered . Beginning with the positive points , the ability to work on assessments and coursework on a computer means that work can be saved safely and transported from place to place . Before the arrival of computers , students traditionally had files and folders with their course notes , and this took up a considerable amount of room and was difficult to keep track of; now , complete lecture notes and much more can be stored on a flash drive that can be easily put in a pocket or bag . In addition , lectures and learning material can be made available online , allowing for a multimedia educational environment . This is likely to engage a wider range of students as it has the ability to cater for a wider range of learning styles . For example , some students study best by repeatedly listening to a teacher , and this can now be achieved more conveniently by having videos available . On the downside , there are occasions where information stored digitally can be deleted , overwritten or corrupted , all situations that do not occur on traditional paper based work . There is also the concern that material can be garnered from the Internet and passed off as the students own work , making plagiarism a potential issue . However , the concept of plagiarism has long been a problem , and there are computer programs available today that will pinpoint the source of non original work", "The world that we live in today is dominated by advertising . Adverts are on television , on the World Wide Web , in the street and even on our mobile phones . However , many of the strategies used to sell a product or service can be considered immoral or unacceptable . To begin with , the fact that we cannot escape from advertising is a significant cause for complaint . Constant images and signs wherever we look can be very intrusive and irritating at times . Take for example advertising on the mobile phone . With the latest technology mobile companies are now able to send advertising messages via SMS to consumer\u2019s phones whenever they choose . Although we expect adverts in numerous situations , it now seems that there are very few places we can actually avoid them . A further aspect of advertising that I would consider unethical is the way that it encourages people to buy products they may not need or cannot afford . Children and young people in particular are influenced by adverts showing the latest toys , clothing or music and this can put enormous pressure on the parents to buy these products . In addition , the advertising of tobacco products and alcohol has long been a controversial issue , but cigarette adverts have only recently been banned in many countries . It is quite possible that alcohol adverts encourage excessive consumption and underage drinking , yet restrictions have not been placed on this type of advertising in the same way as smoking . It is certainly true to say that advertising is an everyday feature of our lives . Therefore , people are constantly being encouraged to buy products or services that might be too expensive , unnecessary or even unhealthy", "Alternative medicine is not new . It is accepted that it pre-dates conventional medicine and it is still used by many people all over the world . I am not convinced that it is dangerous , and feel that both alternative and conventional medicine can be useful . There are several reasons why the conventional medical community is often dismissive of alternatives . Firstly , there has been little scientific research into such medicine , so there is a scarcity of evidence to support the claims of their supporters . Furthermore , people often try such treatment because of recommendations from friends , and therefore come to the therapist with a very positive attitude , which may be part of the reason for the cure . Moreover , these therapies are usually only useful for long-term , chronic conditions . Acute medical problems , such as accidental injury , often require more conventional methods . On the other hand , there remain strong arguments for the use of alternatives . Despite the lack of scientific proof , there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that these therapies work . In addition , far from being dangerous , they often have few or no side effects , so the worst outcome would be no change . One of the strongest arguments for the effectiveness of alternative therapies in the West is that , whilst conventional medicine is available without charge , many people are prepared to pay considerable sums for alternatives . If they were totally unhelpful , it would be surprising if this continues . I strongly believe that conventional medicine and alternative therapies can and should coexist . They have different strengths , and can both be used effectively to target particular medical problems", "These days , more and more people are making the choice to go to university . While some people are of the opinion that the only purpose of a university education is to improve job prospects , others think that society and the individual benefit in much broader ways . It is certainly true that one of the main aims of university is to secure a better job . The majority of people want to improve their future career prospects and attending university is one of the best ways to do this as it increases a persons marketable skills and attractiveness to potential employers . In addition , further education is very expensive for many people , so most would not consider it if it would not provide them with a more secure future and a higher standard of living . Thus job prospects are very important . However , there are other benefits for individuals and society . Firstly , the independence of living away from home is a benefit because it helps the students develop better social skills and improve as a person . A case in point is that many students will have to leave their families , live in halls of residence and meet new friends . As a result , their maturity and confidence will grow enabling them to live more fulfilling lives . Secondly , society will gain from the contribution that the graduates can make to the economy . We are living in a very competitive world , so countries need educated people in order to compete and prosper . Therefore , I believe that although a main aim of university education is to get the best job , there are clearly further benefits", "Crime is a serious and growing problem in most societies . Although many people believe that the best way to tackle this is to place people in prison for longer periods , others are of the opinion that other measures will be more effective . There are benefits of giving offenders longer prison sentences . Firstly , spending a long time in prison provides an opportunity for the prison services to rehabilitate a prisoner . For example , someone who has committed a serious offence such as assault will need a long time in prison in order to be sure they can be re-educated not to re-offend . In addition to this , longer prison sentences will act as a deterrent for someone who is thinking of committing a crime . However , some people argue that leaving people in prison for a long time means that they will mix with other criminals and so their character will not improve . One alternative is community service . This gives an offender the opportunity to give something positive back to society , and so it may improve their character . Also , the government could focus its resources on the causes of crime , which would lead to less crime in the future . In my opinion , it is important to look at alternative methods . Many countries have lengthy prison sentences , but crime has continued to increase throughout the world , so it is clear that this is not completely effective . That said , long prison sentences should remain for those who commit serious crimes such as assault or murder , as justice for the victim and their family should take priority", "These days , the government spends a large part of its budget not only on public services , but also arts . Although I agree that it is important to spend money on public services , I do not think spending on the arts is a waste of money . There are several reasons for spending a significant amount of the government budget on public services . First and foremost , public services are the things such as hospitals , roads and schools , and these things determine the quality of life that most of us will have . For example , if the government does not spend enough money on hospitals , the health of our society may decline . Similarly , if not enough money is spent on schools , our children may not be properly educated . Also , it will be the poor in our society that will be affected more if we do not spend enough on these things because they are the ones more dependent on such services . However , this does not mean that the arts should be completely neglected . To begin , it is difficult for many arts institutions to generate much profit , so without some help from the government , many theaters and other such places may have to close . Moreover , the arts also have an important impact on our quality of life . Many people get great pleasure in going to see music and theatre performances so it is important that the government assists such institutions so that they can continue to provide entertainment to the public . To sum up , there are clear benefits of ensuring a large amount of investment goes into public services as this influences the quality of life for nearly all of us", "Over the last few decades , many cities around the world have seen alarming increases in the levels of youth crime . This essay will discuss the reasons for this and provide some possible solutions . The first reason is connected with the family . In order for a child to grow up in a balanced way , it is very important that he or she is nurtured well by his or her parents . However , these days , it is often the case that children are neglected . This may be because of the fact that many parents in cities now both have to work so are often not around to give their children support when needed . Another factor is the increasing levels of poverty around the world . We have seen with globalization the rich get richer and the poor get poorer , and this inevitably means that those who are poorer will have to resort to illegal means to get what others have . Of course , this will include the children in the poorer families . However , there are ways to tackle such problems . Firstly , one of the ways to combat the problem is to have stricter punishments . Although , as discussed above , it can be outside factors that lead to crime , it is still important to have severe punishments to deter teenagers from crime . All too often , because they are young , the courts are too lenient . Parents also have to take more responsibility for their children\u2019s actions . They too should be punished if their children commit crime", "Traffic congestion in many cities around the world is severe . One possible solution to this problem is to impose heavy taxes on car drivers and use this money to make public transport better . This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a measure . One of the first benefits of such a measure is that the heavy taxes would discourage car owners from using their cars because it would become very expensive to drive . This would mean that they would begin to make use of public transport instead , thus reducing traffic problems and pollution as well . Another benefit would be that much more use would be made of public transport if it was improved . It is often the case that public transport in cities is very poor . For example , we often see old buses and trains that people would rather not use . High taxes would generate enough money to make the necessary changes . Nevertheless , there are drawbacks to such a solution . First and foremost , this would be a heavy burden on the car drivers . At present , taxes are already high for a lot of people , and so further taxes would only mean less money at the end of the month for most people who may have no choice but to drive every day . In addition , this type of tax would likely be set at a fixed amount . This would mean that it would hit those with less money harder , whilst the rich could likely afford it . It is therefore not a fair tax", "Many countries of the world are currently experiencing problems caused by rapidly growing populations in urban areas , and both governments and individuals have a duty to find ways to overcome these problems . Overpopulation can lead to overcrowding and poor quality housing in many large cities . Poorly heated or damp housing could cause significant health problems , resulting in illness , such as bronchitis or pneumonia . Another serious consequence of overcrowding is a rising crime rate as poor living conditions may lead young people in particular to take desperate measures and turn to crime or drugs . In terms of solutions , I believe the government should be largely responsible . Firstly , it is vital that the state provides essential housing and healthcare for all its citizens . Secondly , setting up community projects to help foster more community spirit and help keep young people off the street is a good idea . For example , youth clubs or evening classes for teenagers would keep them occupied . Finally , more effective policing of inner city areas would also be beneficial . Naturally , individuals should also act responsibly to address these problems , and the motivation to do this would hopefully arise if the measures described above are put into place by the government . This is because it will encourage people to have more pride in their own community and improve the situation . Therefore , it is clear that the problems caused by overpopulation in urban areas are very serious", "Over the last ten years , western societies have seen close to a 20% rise in the number of children who are overweight . This essay will discuss some reasons why this has occurred and examine the consequences of this worrying trend . The main cause of this problem is poor diet . Over the last decade there has been a prolific increase in the number of fast food restaurants . For example , on nearly every high street there is a MacDonald\u2019s , Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut . The food in these places has been proven to be very unhealthy , and much of the advertising is targeted at children , thus ensuring that they constitute the bulk of the customers of these establishments . However , it is not only due to eating out , but also the type of diet many children have at home . A lot of food consumed is processed food , especially with regards to ready-made meals which are a quick and easy option for parents who are working hard . The effects of this have been and will continue to be very serious . Firstly , there has been a large increase in health related diseases amongst children , especially diabetes . This debilitating illness means a child has to be injected with insulin for the rest of their life . Not only this , very overweight children often experience bullying from other children , which may affect their mental health . The negative stigma of being overweight may also affect self-esteem . To sum up , it is evident that there are several causes of obesity amongst children , and a variety of negative effects", "To what extent do you agree with such a procedure? Have you any reservations? The cloning of animals has been occurring for a number of years now , and this has now opened up the possibility of cloning humans too . Although there are clear benefits to humankind of cloning to provide spare body parts , I believe it raises a number of worrying ethical issues . Due to breakthroughs in medical science and improved diets , people are living much longer than in the past . This , though , has brought with it problems . As people age , their organs can fail so they need replacing . If humans were cloned , their organs could then be used to replace those of sick people . It is currently the case that there are often not enough organ donors around to fulfil this need , so cloning humans would overcome the issue as there would then be a ready supply . However , for good reasons , many people view this as a worrying development . Firstly , there are religious arguments against it . It would involve creating another human and then eventually killing it in order to use its organs , which it could be argued is murder . This is obviously a sin according to religious contexts . Also , dilemmas would arise over what rights these people have , as surely they would be humans just like the rest of us . Furthermore , if we have the ability to clone humans , it has to be questioned where this cloning will end . Is it then acceptable for people to start cloning relatives or family members who have died? To conclude , I do not agree with this procedure due to the ethical issues and dilemmas it would create", "Today , computer technology is becoming more and more advanced . Many people think that it is wasteful to spend money on maintaining public libraries because most of their functions can be replaced with computer technology . However , I firmly believe that library should never be disregarded by our society . On one hand , the development of computer science has brought about lots of benefits to our lives . Anyone could obtain and store a great amount of information online easily instead of going to public libraries to search for them . People can also read books on the move with their mobile devices such as iPhones , iPads , and so on . Furthermore , people do not have to remember the deadline to return the books . On the other hand , public libraries still have several advantages over the Internet . First , a library always plays an important role as a reliable learning resource . Individuals could get access to sufficient data for their studies when they use public libraries . Second , individuals have more chances to make new friends and exchange learning experience when studying in a library . This opportunity can rarely be found on studying in front of a computer . Compared with only studying via the Internet , students could study in a more quiet and professional environment for academic purposes such as doing researches or graduate thesis . In conclusion , I believe that both public libraries and computer technology are necessary for people to expand their knowledge", "Today , science and technology have a great impact on the whole world in all aspects . However , the role of artists is also undeniable thanks to their contribution to the society . There are many things that artists can tell us about life that science and technology are not able to . To begin with , language , which is surprisingly a branch of art , gives people the sense of humanity , and differentiates human beings from animals . Furthermore , artists can boost our emotions and change our feelings with their artworks . For example , lots of Beethoven\u2019s fans feel relieved and motivated when they listen to his masterpieces . Another field in which we learn from art is related to culture and history . Many countries show their history through a piece of painting or the way that people perform their traditional dances in unique costumes . For instance , \u201cDong Ho\u201d paintings depict not only the daily life of Vietnamese people hundred years ago but also their dreams about a well-off life . For many people , exploring art is also one type of entertainment . There are people who travel around the world to visit historical places and art galleries , which helps them learn more about the culture and history of other nations . By contrast , science and technology are all about practical and physical aspects and contribute less to our lives emotionally and socially . To conclude , there is no denying that science and technology have great values in our lives", "Today , a lot of teenagers find it difficult to choose between getting a job or continuing their education after graduating from high school . Even though there are some benefits of working straight after school , I believe that going to college or university is the better option . There are several reasons why people believe that getting a job is the better choice . First , if people start to work at the age of 18 , they could earn money on their own and be able to live independently without their parents\u2019 financial support . In fact , many students in Western countries tend to find a job after high school to afford their living . Second , people who choose to start their career early instead of going to university or college can have more opportunities to gain real experience and learn exclusive skills for their jobs . Therefore , this may bring out a good chance of getting promoted to higher positions such as managers or executives . On the other hand , I strongly believe that students would gain more benefits if they continue their studies . Firstly , a plenty of employers might ask for high academic qualifications from people applying for some professional jobs . For many high-paying jobs such as statisticians , economists , and medical jobs , master\u2019s degree is one of the most vital requirements . Secondly , today job market is more competitive and a bachelor\u2019s degree or master\u2019s degree in your resum\u00e9 can be a huge advantage compared to other applicants . Employers would prefer a person who has an adequate amount of knowledge to work efficiently with less training time", "First , over-indulgence can be harmful to young children , both socially and developmentally . When kids are provided with the latest must-have items , they are less likely to grasp the notion of sharing or appreciation for their parents\u2019 affection . Eventually , they interpret negative behaviours such as whining or begging as a way to manipulate others . In addition , little do the young ones comprehend the value of hard-earned money if adults keep showering them in spending splurges . Consequently , spoilt kids can become insensitive to the needs of others , are prone to temper tantrum and have trouble deferring gratification . Second , instant gratification could lead to adverse consequences in the future . Children who are spoiled do not have to learn responsible behaviours . Nor do they understand the concept of boundaries as adults and can develop problems such as gambling , overeating or drinking . Lacking in emotional maturity and having poor problem-solving skills , these adults might flounder and become unhappy with their lives . Furthermore , as over-indulged and over protected kids do not grasp the lesson of giving and taking in a relationship , they can have difficulty in establishing and maintaining meaningful friendships . In short , sometimes effective parenting skills involve resisting the desire to give kids whatever they want", "It is said that all children should continue schooling until the age of eighteen . While this policy may prove to be beneficial to a certain extent , I hold the view that it is not fit for all . To begin with , there are a number of apparent reasons for keeping school leaving age to eighteen . First , it is of paramount importance to equip youngsters with fundamental life skills and knowledge so that they can enter the workforce as highly-qualified candidates . Working at an early age , albeit providing valuable hands-on experience , is likely to deter kids from pursuing higher education . In fact , without the proper education and training , rarely could children under eighteen make right career decisions as well as possess appropriate skill sets to negotiate higher base salary . Moreover , teenage years are theoretical milestones of adolescents\u2019 development in shaping their personality traits . Thus , only by staying in education under the guidance and orientation of adults could young people grasp moral behaviours and become law-abiding citizens . On the other hand , I strongly believe that not all children are obliged to attend a school until eighteen . A notable exception is for those with poor academic performance . There are multiple cases of successful entrepreneurs who drop out of school , yet managed to establish a thriving business without any formal education background . In other words , there is no one-size-fits-all approach to learning . Some individuals would learn best through direct contacts with real life circumstances . In addition , gifted kids with special talents should be noticed and nurtured in a different training course to boost their innate ability to the fullest . For example , a girl bestowed with a great voice should spend time on practicing singing skills so that her talent can prosper instead of learning subjects which are not her forte . In short , compulsory education until the age of eighteen is acceptable since children in teenage years still lack intellectual and emotional maturity . However , the essence of education is to tap into the potential in learners", "It is argued that computer skills should be added to the school curriculum alongside traditional core subjects , namely writing , reading and maths . I strongly agree with this view for the following reasons . First , reading skill is of paramount importance to a child\u2019s success . The comprehension of written words equip an individual the ability to understand what is read , and therefore he or she can pursue any area of life that they are interested in . Similarly , people with good writing skills are generally associated as more credible , more capable than those who frequently has typos and grammatical errors . The intrinsic value of literacy skills is to ensure effective communication in our daily lives . Secondly , compulsory algebra courses in the education system would nurture reasoning , analytical thinking which prepare our mind for real problems in life . On the other hand , there are a multitude of reasons why the introduction of computer studies at school is crucial in the era of information technology . Given the enormous amount of valuable material and knowledge available on the Internet , only when one is well-acquainted with basic digital skills , can they take advantage of the countless information resources worldwide . Lack of fundamental computer skills could be easily classified as the biggest culprit behind that cause one individual to lag behind their peers . In addition , proficiency in office-based applications such as Word , Powerpoint and Excel is one of the essential prerequisites if one aspires to thrive in the modern-day workplace . In other words , primary computer-related skills are inextricably linked with career progression as well as keeping apace with the surrounding world", "High school students are studying up on literature , chemistry and world history; however , most are not learning fundamental money lessons to help them financially navigate the real world . Parents\u2019 lack of financial knowledge and negligence towards the matter are the biggest culprits; thus , several measures need to be taken to tackle those heightened concerns . On the one hand , regardless of the fact that an overwhelming majority of teens desire more financial education , neither parents nor educational institutions are paying proper attention to financial literacy . It is said that a number of high schools are doing the bare minimum to equip students with the required skills for money management . In other words , state governments are focused on teaching the core subjects of Maths and English that personal finance often gets overlooked . In addition , parents today are not confident in their abilities to teach their kids about money management . Sadly enough , many parents have not learned critical financial values themselves; hence , they may be passing bad financial habits to their kids . In essence , most teenagers lack personal money management skill as noone around them talks about it . Therefore , it is vital for parents to use financial hardships and strained budgets as an opportunity to talk about finances and teach kids about managing money around the dinner table . Teenage kids should also be included in budget planning through a weekly or monthly allowance . Another feasible approach is the embedding of financial literacy course into the school curriculum . Amongst traditional core subjects , students should be required to complete personal-finance classes to graduate . In conclusion , lack of financial knowledge could leave serious implications on a kid\u2019s livelihood", "The dominance of the Internet technology has brought about drastic changes in almost every aspect of our life , including education . While some people argue that teachers remain the most important factor contributing to student achievement , I am more convinced that students can gain more knowledge through novel learning sources such as the Internet or television . To start with , regarded as the global data warehouse , the Internet offers an enormous amount of knowledge for just about every subject known to man , ranging from arts , history to archeology and astronomy , the lists is simply endless . Thanks to the usefulness of the information available , motivated selflearners can access a wealth of material straight from respectable university sources . Realistically , one can probably find almost anything he wishes to know on the World wide web . Whereas , rigid school curriculum is likely to keep students from realizing their great individual potential . In fact , the needs and learning styles of each student are so varied that a standardized curriculum will not work . On the other hand , supporters of traditional learning environment would argue that the presence of qualified teachers is of paramount importance in helping students acquire knowledge in a systematic way . However , there is mounting evidence that students are becoming alienated and bored by traditional teaching methods . In stark contrast , digital learning tools help every student learn at the best pace and path for them . The opportunity to customize learning sequences for each student will make education more productive . Moreover , by incorporating both visual and audio contents , online learning would provide a more engaging and dynamic experience for students of all ages . Eventually , better engagement would lead to productivity and improved motivation . In conclusion , with the advent of the world wide web , teachers are no longer the only guidance for students", "In recent years , obesity has become one of the most serious health problems among people of all ages , especially children . Although there are people who believe that the government should take the full responsibility to find the solutions for this problem , I would argue that parents and schools also play a vital role in dealing with the issue . On one hand , there are several effective solutions on this problem that the government should consider . First , the government may conduct official conferences and news on the symptoms and effects of obesity to raise public awareness . By this way , people will be encouraged to have an active , healthy diet and lifestyle . Second , advertisements on foods and drinks that contain high level of sugar and fat should be restricted on TV and other means of mass media . In fact , since 2017 , a ban on junk foods and soft drinks advertisement before 9 pm has come into effect by the UK . On the other hand , parents and schools are also responsible for maintaining low level of obesity among their children . One of the main causes that make children overweight and unhealthy is the choice of daily diet by their parents . A healthy nutritional balanced diet is necessary for every children to grow up normally without having any serious diseases . As the lack of physical exercises can also lead to an obese child , an adequate amount of physical education sessions needs to be held weekly by schools for their young students to keep fit and stay healthy", "In the hectic modern-day life , people are increasingly leaning towards a healthier lifestyle . However , whether being health-conscious is for the sake of one individual or for the benefit of society at large is open to debate . In my opinion , I reckon that not only staying healthy would do good to oneself but it also indicates the duty of every citizen . To begin with , one\u2019s mental and physical condition is inextricably linked to their life quality . In essence , those who maintain a good overall health are capable of performing their tasks more effectively than physically weaker counterparts . In other words , a person\u2019s well-being at the grass-roots level provides the foundation for building wealth and reaching desirable financial status . Additionally , a disease-free body allows people to live life to the fullest , experiencing what life has to offer around you . To illustrate this , one can not participate in extreme sports such as bungee jumping or skydiving if their fitness level is not qualified . On the other hand , each citizen should consider taking care of their health a responsibility to sustain communal health . Take the outbreak of EBOLA and SARS as a vivid illustration of a single patient infecting a disproportionate number of contact . This is an important wake-up call for ignorant members in every community . In order to prevent and control the super spreading of emerging viruses , concerted effort of the authority and each inhabitant of great importance . Furthermore , a strong and healthy labour force plays a pivotal role in the economic growth of a nation . Consequently , a thriving country with a steadily rising budget would allocate necessary resources to improve the welfare system , ensuring equal access quality health care to all . In short , human resource is the most valuable asset of a country . Therefore , a healthy community calls for collective actions , in which all the sectors - the local government , individual citizens as well as other groups work together for a common purpose", "In the hectic modern-day life , staying physically and mentally healthy is of paramount importance . While some people argue that medical care should be provided by private entities , I believe that the dominance of private hospitals and clinics pose more threats than benefits . To begin with , private sector is supposedly more efficient and responsive to patients\u2019 needs because of market competition . In order to gain widespread popularity , private practices would employ well-qualified personnel and topnotch treatment facilities , attracting and retaining patients with competitive services . Consequently , by virtue of high-quality medical care and favorable staff\u2019s attitude , patients often choose to bypass free public clinic and opt for private doctors . Another argument in support of private services is the relatively substantial funding compared to public ones . Bountiful financial resources would eventually result in research findings on medicine and treatment for acute health problems , from which patients are intended beneficiaries . On the other hand , advocates of public sectors have highlighted inequities in access to health care resulting from the inability of the poor to pay for private services . There have been cases of private healthcare institutions charging exorbitant fees for medical treatments . Sadly though , the government has little control over the quality and the amount private hospitals and clinics charge the patients . In this situation , citizens are left at the whim of healthcare providers who are mostly driven by profit motives , rather than serving the ailing mankind . Furthermore , there are also moral and ethical issues regarding doctors and nursing staff in private sector . Some physicians would prescribe brand-name medications based on the commissions from pharmaceutical companies", "Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health threats in modern day society . While some people say that the government should hold the responsibility for tackling the problem , I strongly believe that collective actions of individuals and the authority are needed to combat the childhood obesity crisis . First , advocates of the former argument would point out that it is the duty of the government to ensure healthy communities and address public health concerns including childhood obesity epidemic . For instance , they should initiate several strategies aimed at increasing habitual physical activity and sports participation , thereby reducing obesity rates . In addition , the authority also has a part to play in the heavy bombardment of unhealthy food advertising targeting children . In other words , the authority should impose strict censorship of material before it is published , slashing the constant stream of ads for junk food . On the other hand , eating behaviors that affect weight are heavily influenced by elders in a family . The involvement of parents and caretakers , therefore , will be needed to reverse the epidemic . During early childhood , parents are the main source of children\u2019s food and drink which determines whether or not kids experience unhealthy weight gain . Moreover , as children often unconsciously imitate words and actions of others , parents could serve as powerful role models in establishing healthy eating habits and being physically active . Ultimately , under careful parental supervision , children would participate in more active pursuits and adopt healthy eating patterns; hence , lower obesity rates ensue", "It is quite challenging for the city dwellers to exercise adequately . The prevalence of low physical activity among urban population is mainly associated with limited access to exercise facilities and perceived lack of time . Fortunately , there are several measures that can be taken to address these heightened concerns . To begin with , myriad reasons can keep people off their feet; however , the dearth of parks and open spaces in urban settings is identified as one of the biggest culprits behind the decreased physical activity . Sadly enough , excessive urbanization has led to the depletion and transformation of the natural landscape . Ineffective land use and low priority to green spaces would eventually discourage physical activity engagement among citizens . In addition , the shortage of time is another factor that limits exercise participation in urban areas . As the hectic daily schedule puts one in a constant state of stress and hurry , draining most of their energy and time , reluctance to exercise would ensue . In order to promote an active lifestyle among urban dwellers , joint efforts of the authority and individuals are of paramount importance . First , urban designers and planners should create supportive built environments to facilitate physical activity engagement . As green spaces and recreational facilities are the perk of a great neighborhood , their ubiquitous presence would encourage residents to make active living part of their daily routine . Moreover , companies and schools should join hands in incorporating regular exercises into work hours and school hours . By instilling exercise sessions during office hours , businesses are building fitness opportunities for workers to stay fit and healthy; thereby , increasing energy levels , reducing sick days and giving employee productivity a boost . In conclusion , urban infrastructure and the pressure of modern life are major barriers against active living in big cities", "Since several environmental problems have been caused by humans\u2019 forces , we need to act responsibly to reduce the damage that we are doing to the Earth . This essay will explain environmental problems and what governments and individuals can do to address these problems . Two of the threats to the environment are air pollution and waste . Global warming , which is well-known as a global issue because of its devastating effect on the environment , is a result of gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles . In addition , the increase in human population comes along with a huge quantity of waste , which contaminates the Earth and pollutes rivers and oceans . On one hand , governments could reduce air pollution in many ways . First , they could introduce laws to put a limit on factories\u2019 gas emissions or force companies to use renewable energy in production . Second , they could also innovate the public transport system to become more convenient and greener . By this way , governments can encourage people to take public transport instead of driving , therefore reducing emissions . On the other hand , individuals should also be responsible to lower down pollution level in their surroundings . They can take buses and subways or other means of public transportation rather than driving , which could reduce the amount of exhaust fumes from vehicles . Also , people should purchase reusable products and recycle as much as possible to avoid releasing too much waste . For example , Vietnamese people are recommended to use resuable or paper bags when going shopping instead of plastic bags to cut down on plastic bags consumption", "Sustainable development has gradually become a growing concern on a global scale . While some people believe that balancing economic growth and environment protection is nearly impractical , I am more convinced of the opposite views for the following reasons . First , it is common for the society to be induced to think that economic progress is associated with pollutant emission growth and depletable resource consumption . For instant , accelerating urbanization , despite an important instrument for economic development , is one of the driving forces behind the loss of agricultural land . As a result , not only natural habitats that are home to wildlife is endangered but also arable land is shrinking due to urban expansion . In addition , exhaust emissions from manufacturing factories , consisting of harmful particles suspended in the air as well as heavier materials that remain on the surface are contaminating the environment at an alarming rate . The pursuit of high growth at all costs , for example of China - world\u2019s second-largest economy could lead to severe pollution . On the other hand , I still hold a strong belief that the combination of economic and environment sustainability is within our reach . In this era of high technology , scientists have developed multiple alternatives to replace traditional sources of exploitation in many fields . The rise of renewable energy from wind , sunlight or ocean waves would be the answer for escalating demand . What\u2019s even more encouraging is the fact that many countries are joining hands and pooling their resources to cut down industrial pollution . Commitment to protect the environment and prioritize sustainable development over resource extraction would allow the economy to thrive in the long run . In short , even though achieving economic goals is of utmost importance , each nation should incorporate environmental issues in the policy making process", "It is frightening that myriads of terrestrial and marine animals are on the verge of extinction due to human beings . My essay will shed light on the causes and measures to this issue . To begin with , the constant tampering of nature by human has led to drastic changes in the natural world resulting in animals and plants finding it more difficult and difficult to survive . Nearly every kind of habitat or ecosystem - be it land , air or water - has been affected by the uncontrollable destruction of habitats by human . The impact of humans taking land for buildings , farming and timber has rendered species extinct at speeds unprecedented in Earth\u2019s history . Besides , humans , due to their industrial , agricultural , or normal day-to-day activities , release an inordinate amount of toxic waste that is eventually dumped into the air , water or landfills . Tragedies like oil spills have been known to destroy and threaten many aquatic life forms . Having said that , rapid , greatly intensified efforts to address the problem , slowing the extinctions currently underway . First , each government should levy exorbitant fines on devastating behaviors such as littering , illegal dumping or other environmental offences . The implementation of stringent laws , accompanied by extensive media coverage of the issue would raise environmental awareness among all sections of the society . Second , international organizations such as the United Nations should coordinate activities among member countries as well as encourage participation by the private sector to promote sustainable use of the world\u2019s natural resources . Specifically , the presence of such inter-governmental organizations plays a major role in initiating negotiations on reducing industrial pollution level or other toxic waste . In short , the blame for the most recent mass extinction is not natural calamities \u2013 it is human", "People hold different views about how to cope with environment problems . While some people argue that it is the duty of international organization , rather than a single country , to solve environment-related issues , I believe that both parties/ sides should join hands in solving this problem . On the one hand , many countries may share the same environmental concerns; however , they would stem from various causes . Therefore , each nation should implement different policies and measures to address the problem . For example , over-exploitation of natural resources and deforestation are identified as the biggest culprit for desertification in the USA; whereas , the growing rate of desertified land in China has been mainly caused by rapid urbanization . In addition , the priority regarding environmental issue is also varied in each country , calling for different approach and strategies to tackle the problem . To illustrate , in emerging economies such as Vietnam , reducing the worrying level of air pollution from industrial activities is of highest priority . On the other hand , the problems that each government is experiencing are indeed interconnected , hence , concerted efforts by all nations are necessary . Thus , international organizations such as the United Nations play a vital role in promoting and coordinate global action to reduce carbon footprint and curb the global warming threat . Furthermore , wealthy countries should provide financial and technological support for poor nations in the fight against green issues , since the detrimental effects of environmental problems could spread beyond national borders . In other words , an international effort is needed to yield an efficient environment protection scheme", "In the modern life , there are more and more people spending less time with their family . This essay will examine the major causes and possible influences of this phenomenon . To begin with , there are several explanations that are worth mentioning about this issue . The first reason is that due to the fast pace of modern life , people are now living a busier one and devoting an increasing amount of time to work . It is increasingly common that people tend to lose the balance between family and clerical work since they usually spend more time at work and do not come home until late at night . For example , due to the heavy workload many workers have to work more than 10 hours a day , and sometimes they are required to work during weekend or overnight to meet the deadline . The rapid development of social media is the second reason for this trend . That parents and children stay together but hold their own mobile phones or laptops to communicate with online friends on Facebook instead of talking with each other is easily seen these days . This rising issue is having considerable impacts on both individuals themselves and family . First , it is believed that family is where people can share their feelings and problems , which help them to release their stress . However , an individual may experience emotional distress if they do not receive proper support from his/ her immediate family . Second , the bonds between parents and children may be weakened . For instance , when parents do not spend much time with their children , their children will lack of appropriate parental care and attention and are likely to follow a path towards criminal behaviors", "The young today spend a large amount of leisure time in shopping centers . It is fear that this trend can bring about negative influences on the youths and the society . Personally , I strongly disagree with this view . On the one hand , for the young generation spending too much time at the shopping malls can make them waste a great deal of money . As there are dozens of brands with various prices and design for them to choose from , they are easily tempted to buy things impulsively and misspend money on unnecessary stuff . For example , when some big brand names slash the prices , a shopaholic may purchase 10 shirts and jeans in a row and this cost her somewhere $100; however , such items often end up being left in the wardrobe . For the society , because youngsters are unlikely to participate in other activities such as their work or studying , economy may suffer due to less work being done and the youths could slack off their knowledge acquisition , making the national education standard drop significantly . On the other hand , there are also some advantages of this trend . First , in terms of the young , spending time at the malls is considered a method of relaxation . In modern life these days , young people have to deal with lots of pressure from school or workplace , so this trend helps them enjoy their life and effectively release their stress . Second , the society also benefits from this phenomenon . The increase in the amount of consumption will promote manufacture and commerce in the fashion industry , which afterward will create more jobs and boost the economic growth", "Human in general are experiencing a longer life expectancy , which lead to an overwhelming number of people continue to work after the legal retirement age . Whereas , others opt for entering the workforce at an earlier age , and from my perspective , this is a negative development . First , choosing a career path - and the appropriate university courses for that profession - is a decision of paramount importance . Contrary to popular belief , landing on a job while studying - be it a part-time job or an apprenticeship , could easily distract youngsters from fulfilling their duties at school . In essence , in the current climate of obsession with early success , one is put under intense pressure to become successful artists , entrepreneurs and startup CEOs before the age 25 , enjoying retirement with a generous income . That being said , that chilling reality could be a pipe dream for most . In fact , many well-paid jobs , such as doctors or lawyers , require a multi-year commitment to a long training course which can take up to 6 years or more , and thus , are not suitable for those who start working too early , yet lack formal education . On the other hand , there is mounting evidence that many elderly people are physically and mentally fit to stay in work until their 70s . I believe that people who remain in paid employment past retirement age or involved in community or voluntary work improve their chances of staying healthier for longer . Continuing to have a routine and going into a place of work each day can prevent the sense of loneliness that could come with retirement . Furthermore , by engaging in active employment , two problems are solved: the pension and the retirement savings crisis . Financial independence is the ultimate goal that everyone would pursue in order to live comfortably in older age . In short , the youth-obsessed culture has caused young people to take career decisions earlier than previous generations", "Freedom is an abstract concept that cannot be adequately measured on any physical scales . However , many people incline to the view that children these days enjoy a more liberal life than previous generations . My opinion is utterly opposed on this issue for the following reasons . One of the arguments put forth in support of the former statement is that the digital age presents an unparalleled opportunity for kids to gain access to a tremendous amount of information without geographical barriers . Ironically , the advent of the Internet is more of a mixed blessing . Indeed , the obvious merits of the world wide web cannot overshadow a worrying tendency of that growing addiction to electrical gadgets such as laptops , tablets or smartphones . Therefore , early exposure to the virtual world ended up erecting invisible boundaries , inducing kids\u2019 estrangement from actual human interactions . On the other hand , amidst a modern-day hectic world , there is an inordinate amount of pressure on young people to become successful artists , entrepreneurs or startup CEOs before the age of 30 . Consequently , parents would compel their offspring to enroll in highest-paying college majors , oblivious to their utmost passion . In addition , adult supervision seems to be extending into every aspect of children\u2019s lives . Take the recent arrest and jailing in US of a mother for abandoning her nine- year-old daughter to play alone in the park while she worked . In the current climate of obsession with children\u2019s safety , parents who let their youngsters out of sight court the accusation of irresponsibility , if not gross negligence . However , this school of thought may accidentally cause the erosion of children\u2019s freedom to engage with the world at will . In conclusion , while the proliferation of the electronic devices could hamper children\u2019s direct contact with the real world , parents may unintentionally impede a child from acquiring their innate dreams and fundamental life skills for being overprotective", "In the era of information technology , the advent of social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter has gradually become a substitute for face-to-face communication . From my perspective , this growing trend offers more drawbacks than benefits in long term . First , advocates of online communication would argue that it expands the available time and place in which a meeting can occur . For example , one can stay in constant touch with their loved ones via online messenger or video calls regardless of geographical barriers . In business context , rather than having to travel to specific location , people can plan to meet at times that work for all of their schedules . In addition , for professionals and academics , social networking sites allow users to create networks of like-minded people , expanding the horizons of what sort of contacts they can make in their professional lives . While it is impossible to deny the importance of these platforms , and the way that they have revolutionized communication , it is essential to realize their detrimental effects on our life . One issue with these digital forms of communication is that they are counter-intuitive , they have led to fewer interactions rather than encouraging frequent contacts of one person to another . Another negative impact of social networking technology is on interpersonal skills . It is a common sense to handle tough conversations such as breakup or getting fired in person . That being said , many opt for delivering the message online , avoiding the nerve-wracking feeling of telling someone bad news . In fact , the quality of decreasing conversations are suffering as well due to the prevalence of social networking . In conclusion , I believe that the negative influences of social media to people\u2019s relationships overshadow the advantages it might bring", "Today\u2019s world has been divided into developing and industrialized countries where the main difference between them is the amount of money that governments apply in important sectors such as education , health and commerce . Most of the poorer nations are buried in debts as a result of their unbalanced finances which are reflected in a poor health care , an unstructured education system and a weak international trade . This vicious cycle will continue indefinitely unless wealthier nations show interest in minimizing the worldwide economic differences , as well as taking more responsibility for assisting unfortunate countries . Most of the African countries live in inhuman conditions because of the extreme poverty , upheaval , hunger , disease , unemployment , lack of education and both inexperienced and corrupt administrations . The devastating consequences of the AIDS epidemic in those countries could improve if the infected populations receive free drugs to control the disease , have access to health professionals and get information on how to prevent its spread . But this can only be achieved through international help programs in which leaders of the world's richest countries donate medicine and also send doctors and nurses to treat and educate those in need . Moreover , most of the poor countries rely on selling agricultural products and raw material to rich nations and buying industrialized products from them which results in a huge financial deficit . Consequently , they borrow a significant amount of money from the World Bank to try to improve their broken economies , but sometimes the money disappears with no significant changes and they cannot even pay the interest to the bank . Regarding this issue , last year the G8 , which is comprised of leaders of the eight richest nations , decided to forgive billions of dollars worth of debt owed by the world's poorest nations . In addition , they developed adequate loan programs to financially assist those countries . In conclusion , leaders of the industrialized countries play an indispensable role in assisting developing nations deal with essential areas such as health , education and trade", "In the present age , globalization is playing increasingly important role in our lives . But in the meantime whether it is a blessing or a curse has sparked much debate . Some people argue the globalization has fundamentally beneficial influence on our lives while many others contend that it has detrimental effect as well . Convincing argument can be made that globalization not only plays a pivotal role in the development of technology and economy , but also promotes the exchange of cultures between different countries . To start with , it is the globalization that impelled many corporations to become an international group , thereby making contribution to local technology and employment . Specifically , when a multinational group establishes a factory in a developing country , the new equipment , the new management skill and the job vacancies are all in the best interest of local society . Moreover , people worldwide can know each other better through globalization . Admittedly , profit-driven globalization severely affected the young people . Today , in the metropolises in different countries , it is very common sight that teenagers are wearing NIKE T-shirt and Adidas footwear , playing Hi-pop music with Apple I pod and having KFC . The culture that took thousand years to form is just seems similar in these cities; it is looks like you can only distinguish them by their language . Meanwhile , in some developing countries , the existence of sweatshops is always the issue that concerned by WHOM . For instance , some reports show that some teenagers who are employed by Nike's contractor always stay in the factories that are filled with toxic gases over 14 hours a day , but they only work for fifty cents per hour . In summary , I would concede that globalization do come with some adverse effects . Despite that the benefits created by it far outweigh the disadvantages", "It is argued that those who make early career choice and stick to it would probably experience greater job satisfaction than job-hoppers . I strongly disagree with this statements for the following reasons . First , the pursuit of a career path for an extended period of time would ensure financial stability , resulting in greater satisfaction . The interval between the last interview and a job offer or rejection can be intensely frustrating for every candidate . Job search fatigue can wear anyone down with the endless rounds of leads and interviews that never seem to go anywhere . In addition to a steady paycheck , holding down a job for years is a manifestation of loyalty and commitment . From an employer\u2019s perspective , these are significant indicators of promotion among current staff . To a certain extent , the length of employment is closely linked to the opportunity to successfully move up/ climb the corporate ladder . However , advocates of jop jumpers would argue that those who stay with a job for a long time have less diverse skill sets and a relatively narrow range of knowledge . In contrast , one of the greatest advantages of regular job switch is that it allows one individual to gain valuable skills and knowledge in different environments and cultures . In today\u2019s economy , this is equivalent to remain current and constantly updated in a highly competitive market . Furthermore , changing jobs can certainly be a path to higher salary . If one hops once in a while , their number of contacts expand following a bigger potential professional network and more career choice in the future . Thus , job hoppers could actually be in a much better negotiating positions when it comes to dealing a new job offer on account of their diverse experience and contacts across different industries", "In the hectic modern-day life , staying physically and mentally healthy is of paramount importance . While some people argue that medical care should be provided by private entities , I believe that the dominance of private hospitals and clinics pose more threats than benefits . To begin with , private sector is supposedly more efficient and responsive to patients\u2019 needs because of market competition . In order to gain widespread popularity , private practices would employ well-qualified personnel and topnotch treatment facilities , attracting and retaining patients with competitive services . Consequently , by virtue of high-quality medical care and favorable staff\u2019s attitude , patients often choose to bypass free public clinic and opt for private doctors . Another argument in support of private services is the relatively substantial funding compared to public ones . Bountiful financial resources would eventually result in research findings on medicine and treatment for acute health problems , from which patients are intended beneficiaries . On the other hand , advocates of public sectors have highlighted inequities in access to health care resulting from the inability of the poor to pay for private services . There have been cases of private healthcare institutions charging exorbitant fees for medical treatments . Sadly though , the government has little control over the quality and the amount private hospitals and clinics charge the patients . In this situation , citizens are left at the whim of healthcare providers who are mostly driven by profit motives , rather than serving the ailing mankind . Furthermore , there are also moral and ethical issues regarding doctors and nursing staff in private sector . Some physicians would prescribe brand-name medications based on the commissions from pharmaceutical companies", "In the hectic modern-day life , people are increasingly leaning towards a healthier lifestyle . However , whether being health-conscious is for the sake of one individual or for the benefit of society at large is open to debate . In my opinion , I reckon that not only staying healthy would do good to oneself but it also indicates the duty of every citizen . To begin with , one\u2019s mental and physical condition is inextricably linked to their life quality . In essence , those who maintain a good overall health are capable of performing their tasks more effectively than physically weaker counterparts . In other words , a person\u2019s well-being at the grass-roots level provides the foundation for building wealth and reaching desirable financial status . Additionally , a diseasefree body allows people to live life to the fullest , experiencing what life has to offer around you . To illustrate this , one can not participate in extreme sports such as bungee jumping or skydiving if their fitness level is not qualified . On the other hand , each citizen should consider taking care of their health a responsibility to sustain communal health . Take the outbreak of EBOLA and SARS as a vivid illustration of a single patient infecting a disproportionate number of contact . This is an important wake-up call for ignorant members in every community . In order to prevent and control the super spreading of emerging viruses , concerted effort of the authority and each inhabitant of great importance . Furthermore , a strong and healthy labour force plays a pivotal role in the economic growth of a nation . Consequently , a thriving country with a steadily rising budget would allocate necessary resources to improve the welfare system , ensuring equal access quality health care to all . In short , human resource is the most valuable asset of a country . Therefore , a healthy community calls for collective actions , in which all the sectors - the local government , individual citizens as well as other groups work together for a common purpose", "Modern parents are giving into children\u2019s demands and buy them all the latest toys and gadgets . I would argue that on no account can this parenting style bring any benefits for kids in the long run . Worse still , this negative education would cause detrimental consequences when they reach adulthood . First , over-indulgence can be harmful to young children , both socially and developmentally . When kids are provided with the latest must-have items , they are less likely to grasp the notion of sharing or appreciation for their parents\u2019 affection . Eventually , they interpret negative behaviours such as whining or begging as a way to manipulate others . In addition , little do the young ones comprehend the value of hard- earned money if adults keep showering them in spending splurges . Consequently , spoilt kids can become insensitive to the needs of others , are prone to temper tantrum and have trouble deferring gratification . On the other hand , instant gratification could lead to adverse consequences in the future . Children who are spoiled do not have to learn responsible behaviours . Nor do they understand the concept of boundaries as adults and can develop problems such as gambling , overeating or drinking . Lacking in emotional maturity and having poor problem-solving skills , these adults might flounder and become unhappy with their lives . Furthermore , as over-indulged and over protected kids do not grasp the lesson of giving and taking in a relationship , they can have difficulty in establishing and maintaining meaningful friendships . In short , sometimes effective parenting skills involve resisting the desire to give kids whatever they want", "While some people argue that it is the government\u2019s responsibility to pay for road construction , I believe that car users should be charged for the service . To start with , there are some arguments put forth in support of the government\u2019s spending on road building and maintenance . First , an efficient road transport system plays a pivotal role in ensuring smooth traffic flow , giving a boost in trade activities within the country and economic growth at large . For example , modern road infrastructure has a crucial part to play in the rapid development of major cities in the world such as New York or Paris . Furthermore , the convenience and safety of citizens should be of paramount concern of the authority . Therefore , each level of government is obliged by law to provide and maintain the national road network such as local roads , bridges or foot paths . However , I strongly support the latter opinion that car commuters should cover the cost of road infrastructure . Compared to walking or cycling which leave little visual damage on road , cars definitely take up more space on city streets , and high demand for car use in everyday life causes road deterioration at an increasingly fast rate . For this reason , roadbuilding and expansion mostly facilitate drivers so that they can travel safely and smoothly . Besides , car owners normally have significantly higher income than others . Funding for new construction and repair , thus , is a form of lifting the financial burden on less fortunate ones in order that the community as a whole can enjoy a better living standard", "Space tourism industry is officially open for business , and tickets are sold at scarily exorbitant prices . However , the growing trend of paying a visit to outer space is open to debate . From my perspective , this novel form of travel offers more benefits than drawbacks . To begin with , a holiday beyond the stratosphere is an eye-opening experience for travellers . Since the dawn of time , it has been an intangible desire to explore and challenge the boundaries of what we know and where we have been amidst this vast universe . The possibility of being able to travel to space would not only satisfy one\u2019s curiosity but also enrich their knowledge to a great extent . In addition , such a dramatic shift in perception would make an individual learn to value the life on Earth , raising self-awareness in protecting our Mother Nature . Therefore , space travel should be made equally available to ordinary members of the public . On the other hand , opponents of space tourism argue that this extravagant service is limited to professional astronauts and top one percent of the population who own the majority of the world\u2019s wealth . This may be true given the small customer base and during the pioneering phase . That being said , growing demand accompanied by the development in orbital facilities will pave the way for mass phase in which tickets to orbit cost less and the number of passengers per year expand quickly . Eventually , a boom in space tourism would induce job opportunities in every line of business - from construction to interior design and marketing . Once orbital flights are made on a regular basis , scientists and government agencies are motivated to reach new heights in space technology , achieving historic breakthrough such as finding evidence of life forms on other planets . In conclusion , developing space tourism is a challenging issue and it may take a long time to become an affordable service to all , rather than a pastime for the rich", "Whether the government budget should be invested in traffic infrastructure or public transport systems is open to debate . In my opinion , each has substantial contribution to the society; and therefore should receive equal fundings . To start with , better road quality would have an instant positive effect on the daily commute of citizens . In developing countries , it is relatively more convenient to travel by private vehicles in lieu of waiting for buses and trains with restricted routes and schedules . However , the staggering number of cars , motorbikes and scooters has led to one of most the aching issues in downtown areas which is urban traffic congestion in downtown areas . A feasible measure to this matter is that the authority should spend money on expanding road capacity and implement road improvement scheme . As a result , there will be more space for a larger volume of traffic and safer roads for all inhabitants . On the other hand , state funding for public transport is another radical resolution to the increasing traffic density . Take the metro systems in Hanoi which are currently under construction and projected to be in operation by 2020 . Beside road building and maintenance , major cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh city invested a huge chunk of money in its metro projects to cope with heavy congestion and frequent traffic accidents . Moreover , better public transport system would create a major lifestyle shift , encouraging people to give up their private vehicles . In other words , promoting the use of public transport would dramatically alleviate air pollution particularly in emerging economies", "There is widespread concern that the prevalence of instantaneous communication tools negatively impacts interpersonal bonds . I disagree completely with this viewpoint because of how modern communication facilitates not just long-distance interactions but also global social engagement . Some worry that individuals may grow more isolated if more convenient modes of communication , such as smartphones and social media , become the norm . They argue that by emphasizing virtual communication over real-world encounters , these technologies risk weakening the foundations of interpersonal bonds . This assertion , however , is vastly inflated . Virtual communication actually strengthens interpersonal bonds rather than weakening them . Most Facebook users , for instance , have face-to-face conversations with friends and coworkers in addition to exchanging messages online . Facebook's additional tools , such as instant messaging and video chatting , do not replace face-to-face communication but rather help us maintain relationships over great distances . In addition to addressing the issue of distance , as stated above , these technologies also allow us to widen our social networks . Some examples of such communities are online forums like Reddit , which bring together people with a shared interest in the arts , history , video games , or linguistics , and photo-sharing applications like Pinterest , which may bring together a group of individuals with similar tastes in photography . These communities allow for in-depth conversations and debates on a global scale , something that is difficult to do in person . Therefore , advances in communication have not been at the expense of interpersonal connections but rather have strengthened them", "For some , women would make for superior leaders . I recognize that women might have an advantage in empathy and collaboration , but I also believe that men's capacity for strategic thinking is an essential quality in a competent leader . In some elements of being a leader , women are superior to men for several reasons . In terms of compassion and teamwork , women tend to surpass males . Ultimately , these two characteristics will produce competent leaders . Numerous sovereign states , such as Germany and Finland , have had female officials , and the majority of these nations are recognized for exercising caution in the majority of their judgments , granting more rights to community members , and eliminating the gender pay gap . Regarding their international relations , these countries are typically commended for their amicable connections . However , research shows that men may be superior to women in their capacity to think strategically . Leaders with this skill have a better probability of making decisions that will favor their teams and businesses . Across the board , men dominate senior management ranks and are widely recognized as experts in a wide range of fields . In addition , women are impractically constrained by responsibilities outside leadership jobs , such as managing work and family . Pregnancy , for instance , often necessitates time off from work for women but not for males . In conclusion , I consider both men and women to have something valuable to contribute and are capable of serving as effective leaders", "Today , some claim that businesses should also have social obligations . While I acknowledge that the primary purpose of any company is to generate profits , businesses should also make social contributions within their sphere of influence . On the one hand , it seems logical that the primary objective of companies engaged in a free market should be to achieve sound financial health . Every form of organization incurs expenditures . Office space , legal costs , payroll , company credit cards , and other institutional expenditures may rise exponentially . According to the U . S . Small Business Administration , the average cost to establish a micro-business is approximately $3 , 000 , whereas the estimated cost to initiate a home-based franchise is almost $5 , 000 . In addition to these one-time fees , utilities and other recurring expenses must also be paid periodically . Without being realistic about a startup's financial flow and debt , the owner will be unable to operate . In these situations , the societal obligations of a company become obsolete . On the other hand , there is no distinction between individuals and businesses regarding their ethical responsibilities . Given that social evils are solvable , businesses should share equal accountability with governments for society's betterment . For instance , the Vietnamese YouTube channel \"Quang Linh Vlogs\" has received enthusiastic support from both Vietnamese and Angolans . In the recordings , Linh and his team instruct local Angolans on how to grow vegetables and raise livestock . Linh also launched a social project to assist 5 , 000 underprivileged children in school by renovating and equipping classrooms . They proved that it is more humanitarian for businesses to contribute to society than to maximize revenue", "Some believe that the ideal response to the present environmental issue would be to increase the price of gasoline for all private automobiles . Although this would have a measurable effect , I believe a more comprehensive approach is preferable . One may argue that raising gas prices would have a discernible effect . This is because vehicle ownership is on the rise around the globe in both developing and industrialized nations . However , suppose the expense of daily commuting surpasses the benefits it would provide to a family already having trouble making ends meet each month . In that case , that family may choose other methods of transportation instead . Therefore , the number of personal vehicles would decrease as people adjust to higher petrol prices and opt for more affordable transportation , including walking , bicycling , carpooling , and public transit . This , in turn , lessens CO2 emissions , one of the significant factors in the world\u2019s environmental problems . On the other hand , a more substantial impact might be achieved by other policies that do not unintentionally target the less fortunate . Since most tiny levies would not deter upper-class individuals , it is doubtful that the solution above will have the intended effect . Instead , governments should consider everything from deforestation and disposable plastics to industrial fossil fuel usage . Governments must deploy a wider range of strategies , including higher taxes , stricter laws , and educational campaigns , to effectively and sustainably tackle these concerns . As demonstrated , addressing a single factor , like fuel cost , will have a negligible effect , while seeking a broader environmental strategic approach would be more beneficial", "Many people feel that music is largely used for stress relief . I completely agree with this opinion because even though there are various uses for music , they can all be broadly classified as methods of relaxation . Music can be arguably used for more than simply relaxing , as it also provides other numerous claimed applications . Many individuals , for example , listen to music and dance in more dynamic contexts , such as casinos and bars . Other people resort to music to cope or boost their spirits through difficult emotional times , such as after a messy divorce or the passing of a beloved family . Furthermore , for some , music is also a humanly engineered creative process concerned with harmonizing voice or instrumental sounds to show emotional expression . Countless studies have shown that regardless of artistic medium , creating a piece of art , or in this example , a musical performance , may lessen one's stress levels by focusing on creativity . Even so , the circumstances listed above may all be regarded as forms of stress relief , and music's most prevalent objective is pure relaxation . People relax in various ways , which might include dancing , emotionally engaging with music , or admiring art . The majority of adults , on the other hand , just consume music throughout the day to alleviate the stresses and obligations of parenthood and work . Additionally , research confirms that listening to music seems to be able to change brain functioning to the same extent as medication , thus concluding that music is an easy stress reduction tool that almost anybody can access . This explains why music appeals to children , teenagers , and adults , particularly after a long day of work or study . In conclusion , from my perspective , while music can be used for a variety of purposes , they can all be generically classed as ways of relaxing", "Technology advancement has resulted in a profusion of digital platforms . As a result , the vast majority of people believe that daily newspapers are no longer necessary . As a consequence , in my opinion , an up-to-date broadcast is now available on electronic devices . In the following paragraphs , I will clarify my position . There are numerous reasons to support this notion . Nowadays , getting news on the internet provides a number of advantages . For starters , internet papers keep readers up to date faster than traditional periodicals . For example , we can acquire global updates instantaneously on the internet , but it would take publications a few days to investigate and publish the data officially . Second , the internet allows users to access free material and the most up-to-date information without having to purchase physical newspapers from stores , allowing them to save money and time . On the other hand , I believe that physical diaries are still indispensable for a variety of reasons . The first is that they are one of the most reliable sources of information . Because anybody may create and upload articles on the internet , they may include untrustworthy material that has not been adequately vetted before release . Furthermore , online journals frequently have a detrimental impact on people's health . For example , if we spend many hours each day reading online news on our mobile phone or computer , this might have a negative influence , particularly on our eyes", "Some say that government should have complete control over scientific research . While governments must play an important role in technological advancement , I feel that collaboration between government and private funding would be more beneficial . People feel that governments should oversee scientific research for a variety of reasons . To begin , scientific study , by definition , necessitates enormous effort , time , and money . It is thought that only the government , with the well-being of the entire population in mind , can continually invest in these initiatives and will not sacrifice the long-term purpose for a short-term financial benefit . Second , some scientific endeavors , if allowed unchecked , are likely to produce social or ethical difficulties , undermining society's value . For instance , genetic engineering technology has sparked several debates and is presently subject to government oversight . Finally , most science funding comes from tax income; as a result , individuals want their tax dollars to be used under the supervision of government officials . Nevertheless , as long as these technological programs are driven by the government , I believe private sector engagement will undoubtedly contribute to the end aim . The fundamental reason is that government personnel are not professionals in either the scientific or business sectors , but private funds are more specialized in the implementation of scientific achievements since they are profit-driven . With genuine economic rewards achieved by those studies , relevant employees may be more encouraged to do more research . Furthermore , government personnel are occasionally understaffed and inefficient . Without such teamwork , people risk becoming overwhelmed by the volume of work and communication", "Many believe that modern technological development has done more harm than good to both the individual and society as a whole . Even though I do agree that technology has complicated human life to an unhealthy degree , turning away from technology is quite impractical as it could improve overall public health and education . First and foremost , our lives have become too complex and riddled with daily annoyances . True solitude is no longer the case for an average adult as we are now often buried under layers of work-related email notifications or text messages . Even in the young , there are numerous phone applications for students to receive and turn in home assignments . Evidently , this need to stay constantly connected is stressful and exhausting . Another point worth considering is that daily entertainment is also linked with technological devices such as televisions , computers , or smartphones , all of which are extremely addictive . Reports from multiple countries have shown that there is irreversible damage to human brains from excessive screen-time usage . It is scientifically proven that people with this addiction experienced a decrease in grey matter volume in critical areas , a condition similarly observed in those with a substance use disorder . At the same time , medical and educational technologies have been providing innumerable benefits to modern society . In fact , due to medical advances , doctors are now able to diagnose health problems 300% more accurately than just five decades ago . This greatly facilitates timely intervention and improves positive outcomes . Furthermore , innovative medical products can now also replace and sustain failing body functions , thereby supporting people in living full and active lives . Additionally , the use of information and communication technologies plays a crucial role in providing a more accessible learning process . In the recent Covid-19 pandemic , for instance , \u201clearning poverty\u201d was at an all-time high for most underdeveloped countries . As local schools were forced to close due to the disease , remote learning was then deployed using a combination of TV , Online , and Mobile Platforms , which can teach thousands of students simultaneously . Commendably , now most countries have invested in digital infrastructure , and are still utilizing various implementations of remote learning", "\ufeffThe restriction of legal violation scenes shown via media channels should be introduced by the related authorities due to their detrimental impacts . From my perspective , I would express my strong opposition to that suggestion as broadcasting criminal cases through multimedia sites is beneficial in terms of educating citizens and exercising caution in dealing with serious offenses . On the one hand , the detailed description of crimes in newspapers and on TV would be disadvantageous due to the possibility that people would commit the same criminal acts and display anxiety toward the unsafe society . Regarding the former drawback , showing the wrongdoings of criminals publicly on media networks provides individuals with a clear understanding of how the infringement was conducted , from which they may learn and follow . As a consequence , there are high chances that those people , especially youngsters , would become potential offenders in the future . Not to mention that by televising a myriad of violation occurrences , mental health problems would experience a drastic increase since citizens are prone to develop anxiety toward an unsecured society . On the other hand , broadcasting more crime scenes on social media websites can be considered a means of education and caution for people . Chief among these is that broadcasting more violations of crimes in combination with their severe punishment plays a pivotal role in eradicating the intention of future offenders . Therefore , the increasing rate of the number of to-be-culprits would be significantly reduced . In addition , by exemplifying in detail the procedure of a breach , individuals would be more well-aware of the feasibility of a criminal case . Thus , they would have a tendency to prepare for approaches to avoid being victims of wrongdoings", "As the Internet and computer are becoming more prevalent than ever , many people question the necessity of cultural and historical museums . I strongly oppose the idea that information that is now easily accessible via the use of computers can replace museums . The first reason museums are irreplaceable is that the experience of visiting a museum is unique . Most museums nowadays offer a wider variety of information than that on the Internet . For example , museums have more exhibits , simply because some do not have the right to be posted online . Moreover , many exhibitions , especially cultural ones , use a combination of audio , lighting , or even scents to introduce the subject . Also , museum collections are carefully curated , which is not a feature found online . Curators work tirelessly to acquire and sort exhibits to present culture or a historical period as objectively and scientifically accurate as possible . All of these factors are mostly not available online , which is why museums are necessary . The second reason computers cannot replace museums is the information provided through the Internet is insufficient . A major problem with information online is that , unless it is posted on an academic or government-affiliated website , it is largely unverifiable . As a result , readers cannot grasp the full picture of the topic presented . Another problem with only relying on information online is that researching online requires people to first think of the subject . Few people do that . On the other hand , visiting museums can teach people things they might not expect . For example , many US tourists reportedly said that they surprisingly felt a need to review their understanding of the Vietnam War after they visited the US War Museum in Ho Chi Minh City . Without going to that museum , they might never think about such a topic for the rest of their lives", "\ufeffWorking motivation has been attributed to a myriad of sources . Certain individuals are of the opinion that earning is of utmost importance that drives people to devote themselves to work . Although I am in consummate accord with the notion , I still think that other contributors including the purpose of the job and healthy competition between employees can also be regarded as elements motivating people to work harder . On the one hand , the significance of money earned by individuals from working has been attached to its paramount importance in fulfilling a desired life and solidifying one\u2019s social status . It goes without saying that the majority of people work in a financial-oriented way to support other aspects of life such as recreation , education , or healthcare . Without financial means , people would desperately struggle to equip themselves with knowledge and handle extreme emergencies . Not to mention that the more money people make , the more respect they can gain from others . Social status has long been ascribed to the sound financial stage that each person can reach . Therefore , people are more dedicated to working to earn more money with an aim of achieving higher social recognition and admiration . On the other hand , there are multiple other ways to incentivize employees to work hard without financial involvement . The first motivation comes in the form of healthy competition between colleagues . In a community where workers are challenged against one another to deliver the best results , it will create a drive to work harder . This should be noted , though , that this healthy competitive attitude can turn into aggressive workplace politics if not supervised . Another motivation is when employees feel that they are serving a greater purpose in doing their jobs . For example , doctors and nurses work harder than in any other profession because they feel they have the responsibility to save lives . In conclusion , the promise of earning ample money motivates employees to work hard in various ways", "The fact that sporting events have become a fertile ground for advertisements has become a hot topic for debate , with many arguing that this trend affects the sports industry negatively . From my perspective , I partly disagree with the statement . To begin with , sports events being used as a platform for promotion can offer both the events and the sports team tremendous benefits . Firstly , advertising can help cover the event planning costs and make the events more accessible . Internationally-acclaimed sporting competitions can cost the host countries an astronomical amount of money that without sponsorships from large corporations , would not be paid off unless the entrance ticket is high-priced . This would drive fans away and hurt the event\u2019s profit . For example , the 2021 Tokyo Olympics game is reported to have generated 2 . 25 billion US dollars in advertising revenue , which is almost 20 percent of the hosting cost . Secondly , advertisements can give sportsmen a better living standard , thus helping them take their mind off money problems and focus on the games . Some players even got rich thanks to product endorsements , namely Ronaldo and Messi Nevertheless , promoting products during sporting events can bring about negative consequences if the product is not ethical . As sports stars are influential figures , sports teams should be careful about what products they can endorse . To be more specific , research from Yale University in 2013 claimed that some sports sponsorships that featured junk food had increased the rate of child obesity . This is because children are impressionable , therefore , once they see famous athletes with fast food , they can have the wrong impression that this kind of food is wholesome and develop cravings for junk food", "Certain individuals are of the opinion that the governmental allocation of financial resources should be distributed to other impoverished countries while others suppose that it is of paramount importance to focus on curbing their domestic issues . From my perspective , I am in consummate agreement with the proposal of determining national priority on internal problems . On the one hand , it is understandable that crossborder support is a symbol of humanity . Geographically , people are divided into different ethnicities but by nature , humanity is the core connected feature among individuals . Thus , it goes without saying that supporting other countries through the provision of financial or social assistance is a logical and praiseworthy action . Not to mention that helping other nations to deal with financial crises would eliminate the chances of illegal migration which is detrimental to surrounding developed regions . However , I opine that concentrating on addressing domestic issues such as homelessness or unemployment should be an utmost urgency of any country . To begin with , financial fund from the government is regarded as a crucial means to reserve and maintain welfare schemes as well as social security . The smooth flow of how society works would create a favorable environment for job opportunities which accordingly increases the economic growth rate . Furthermore , employment chances , as a result , generate more personal budgets which people can use to afford decent shelters decreasing the homelessness rate", "The notion that raising the cost of fuel for transportation can alleviate environmental issues have been gaining traction . From my point of view , while this solution can help tackle environmental problems to a degree , creating an incentive for individuals and enterprises to take action against these problems would be a more effective approach . On the one hand , an increase in the cost of fuel may prove effective in decreasing the traffic volume , thus reducing harmful emissions that can affect the environment . First , this policy would raise people\u2019s awareness of the frequency and length of their travels . Due to the rise in expenses , people would have to cut down on unnecessary trips . Moreover , as fuel prices soar , more sustainable mobility choices that rely less on carbon-intensive fuels , namely buses that run on biofuel , will witness a surge in demand . To illustrate , in America , since 2010 , hybrid vehicles and smaller transports have had a growing market as a consequence of rising fuel prices . On the other hand , increasing fuel cost cannot tackle all environmental issues . As a matter of fact , car emissions are not the sole cause , but emissions from livestock farming and other industries are also significant contributors to pollution . To illustrate , what is surprising is that livestock accounts for 64 percent of total methane emission - a destructive gas for the ozone layer . Hence , providing individuals and businesses with an incentive to protect the environment would be more effective . For example , the government can apply a lower tax on companies which leave less impact on their surroundings . In this way , enterprises will proactively find ways to reduce their carbon footprint . All in all , increasing fuel prices can help solve environmental problems to a degree", "In today\u2019s competitive economy , many believe that one needs to be knowledgeable in maths in order to excel in business . While I believe that math is indeed an important element of any worker\u2019s skill set , I argue that it is not vital to the success of an individual; this is because whether maths is important is dependent both on the business and the position of the employee or employer holds . It is apparent that mathematical ability has increasingly been sought out by employers as a sign that the employee will succeed within a business . This proficiency in maths not only allows individuals to analyze large quantities of data , but also demonstrates the ability to think critically . Therefore , those who are talented at maths can not only help businesses predict future trends and stay one step ahead of their opponents , they might be able to assist in logistics or administrative tasks as well . This is why for example why top financial institutions and technology companies , such as Goldman Sachs and Tesla , often pay premiums in order to recruit the top mathematicians from prestigious universities . However , it could also be argued that the most successful businessmen might not need to be well versed in mathematics , since they can simply employ employees who are . Many managers and CEOs simply do not have time to do every single calculation that involves their business , and instead , focus their time on managing relationships and communicating with people . It could be said that their function is thus not to manage the business , but to manage people - their role is to find and bring out the best in people that can perform jobs better than them through specialization", "It is suggested that unrestrictedly cross-border trading of products among countries in the world should be encouraged . Although I acknowledge the benefits of this suggestion , I still believe that its drawbacks including the possibility of smuggling and detrimental impacts on local culture worth more concern . Those who advocate unrestrained transnational commerce may point to opportunities to promote domestic and international economy as well as access to a variety of products . Chief among these is that commercial freedom stimulates importing and exporting activities which provide enterprises with more opportunities to connect with a myriad of international business partners , thereby expanding their trading environment . Such a practice is of paramount importance in generating more profit , which subsequently boosts the growth of the economy domestically and internationally . Another point worth mentioning is that exchanging goods under no governmental restrictions offers full accessibility to a diversity of products . Therefore , all citizens in the world have chances to experience exotic items originating from other far-flung regions , which consequently expand one's knowledge and widen their horizons . Despite the aforementioned benefits , I still argue that the disadvantages of cross-border commerce namely the probability of smuggling and adverse effects on national culture should be taken into consideration . With regard to the former , the proliferation of illegal trading would be negatively encouraged when no policy is established by the government . For instance , under no national restrictions , there will be an upsurge in the amount of marijuana imported from Portugal , where it is decriminalized , to our country due to an exceeding demand and substantial profits . From the cultural viewpoint , a strong preference for foreign products , such as food or clothes , may exert disadvantageous impacts on local culture . Gradually , people\u2019s understanding of their national cuisines , as well as traditional costumes , become eroded , which leads to the unexpected consequence of assimilation", "Juveniles these days demonstrate their personal preference for different media such as books and films instead of putting emphasis on hands-on experiences when learning . While I acknowledge that there are still a certain number of people who prefer the latter , I think that it is more reasonable to widen young people\u2019s knowledge via books and movies . Those who advocate the paramount importance of real-life experiences in learning may point to its provision of practical knowledge . It goes without saying that firsthand experiences offer individuals the authentic sensation as well as a long-lasting understanding of a myriad of subjects . For example , in comparison to reading about the production of ceramics through books , participating in making them greatly enhances people\u2019s comprehension of its process , which will definitely last longer in our memory and the experience will not be ever replaced . Learning through books and movies , on the other hand , is more recommendable in terms of financial affairs and the variety of contents . With regard to the former , written form of texts and films cost much less considerable amount of money compared to the payment for hands-on experiences . A book about the history and geography of Hoi An - an ancient town in central Vietnam , for instance , is undoubtedly much more affordable compared to a journey to this breathtaking hotspot . Looking at the second idea , advancements in technology have facilitated the growth of the Internet where the proliferation of movies has been encouraged , which fosters the diversity of data that people can utilize for learning purposes . The process of obtaining new knowledge is supported by a wide range of content , which makes the attempt to gain firsthand experience become meaningless", "People usually put the blame for juvenile delinquency on parents . From my perspective , however , exerting discipline on parents for their children\u2019s wrongdoings is not justified as every individual is responsible for their own actions and kids are also influenced by other factors . Parents ought to primarily take accountability for their children\u2019s malpractice as they are supposed to be role models for their offspring from the early days of kids' lives . It could be true that juveniles\u2019 misbehaviors which violate the law may derive from observation of their parents . And since youngsters are acutely sensitive , they can be affected at ease . For example , if parents are offenders who cheat others for money , their children would suppose it as normal and consequently commit the same crime in possible cases in the future . Notwithstanding the aforementioned arguments , I hold the belief that punishment should not be inflicted on parents when their offsprings break the law . The first reason can be attributed to individuals\u2019 responsibility for their actions . Each person is a separate individual who has his or her own will in engaging in a myriad of activities . It is , therefore , morally wrong and may habour resentment and ill-will when people are punished for the acts that they did not perform . Another point worth mentioning is that children are influenced by not only parents but also other factors such as peers or anti-social content on the Internet . Frequent exposure to toxic friends at school or violent topics on social media , for instance , may evoke the child\u2019s irritability and temperament , which could be the potential root of crime-committing activities . Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that other parties should share responsibility for children\u2019s evil deeds", "Advancement in technology has fostered the availability of operating systems that can translate text automatically . Despite this development , I hold the belief that the process of obtaining lingual knowledge is still beneficial in terms of career prospects and cultural experience . It goes without saying that machine translation can bring greater benefits in terms of speed and a variety of languages . Regarding the former , it is undeniable that computer programs can translate texts much faster than human translators , making the former a much better option when the time given is limited or when only an approximate or summary translation is needed . Concerning the second advantage , artificial intelligence software is capable of translating multiple languages . A prime example of this is Google Translate , as it can instantly recognise and translate up to one hundred languages , thereby being used basically throughout the entire world . Nevertheless , I think that having a clear comprehension of languages is more advantageous in working and experiencing the culture . Some may say that the more languages individuals can master , the more chances of job promotion they may be offered . Since the world has virtually been a global village in which international trade has enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation . The proficiency in languages , thus , provides people with many employment opportunities and eventual success in life . Another benefit that is worth considering is the cultural exposure that one may have when discovering any language . Undoubtedly , language is one of the authentic reflections of its culture; thus , linguistic learning would play a pivotal role in the provision of cultural experience that electronic translators fail to deliver . In conclusion , although machine translation software can produce less accurate texts , faster translation and the range of language options it can offer are undeniably convenient", "Opinions are divided on whether the ultimate responsibility of educational institutions is shaping students into productive citizens or fostering the awareness of individual advantages . While I agree with this idea , I also think that it is of paramount importance to train children as people who gain for themselves . It goes without saying that schools play a pivotal role in teaching disciplines and training skills that turn students into productive citizens and workers . Teachers , undoubtedly , are those who guide children in differentiating between right and wrong as well as leading them to take the right path in life . Once moral lessons are fully obtained , children can be principled and aware of the significance of being good citizens . Also , since the dawn of time , the primary function of education is to enhance the understanding of people; thus , it is the schools\u2019 responsibility to provide their students with essential knowledge as well as practical skills to be intellectual and become innovative workers in the job market . However , schools should benefit children as individuals because these institutes are crucial in\u00a0 helping children to emotionally develop and unleash their potential . Firstly , children promote their early social interaction with peers at school , via which they can foster friendships and companionship . Thus , these social contacts are proven to be helpful in assisting the advancement of internal emotion as well as feeling . Besides , through subjects learning at educational establishments , children have more chances to expose themselves to various fields , which would accordingly help them discover their likes and dislikes . In this way , schools\u2019 aim is achieved in terms of nourishing students\u2019 strengths and improving their weaknesses", "Whether fathers should be given paternity leave has become a topic of debate . From my point of view , this notion is commendable for several reasons . To start with , allowing for men\u2019s use of parental leave will help relieve stress off their partners and themselves . First , fathers and mothers alike experience tension prior to , during , and after childbirth; therefore , paternity leave should be given to help them cope with a new phase in their lives . It has been scientifically proven that males can undergo couvade syndrome , in which fathers-to-be suffer from some of the similar symptoms as their pregnant partners . If these men are forced to work , their productivity could decrease and their work quality may be affected negatively . Moreover , taking care of a newborn is oftentimes a taxing phase in a woman\u2019s life; that is why having their partner share the burden of childcare will be mentally and physically beneficial to new mothers . Spouses can take turns looking after the baby , letting the other parent rest and at the same time , forming close bonds with their child . In addition , paternity leave can be financially beneficial , especially towards working mothers . In families where the woman is the main breadwinner , having the husbands stay at home to look after their children can help relieve financial stress . Additionally , paternity leave can also contribute to reducing the wage gap between males and females by empowering mothers to preserve their profession and delegating equal parenting responsibilities between the two sexes , leaving more time for women to focus on their careers . Moreover , for families in which the grandparents cannot help taking care of newborns , the parents can save a huge amount of money on nannies to support new mothers since the fathers can play that role . To conclude , fathers should have the right to take time off work after their children are born", "The development of technology has fostered various innovations . One of which is being able to enjoy entertainment performances at home from one\u2019s laptop . From my point of view , even though watching concerts online offers viewers flexibility and comfort , attending a live performance has more benefits for the audience and performers . On the one hand , online performances have their own advantages . To start with , people can save a lot of money and time from opting for shows\u2019 online versions . Due to its minimal requirements - a screen-based device and internet connection , people can entertain themselves anywhere and anytime . Moreover , fees for online performances are significantly lower than for live ones , meaning that more people will get to see shows without having to pay handsomely . Furthermore , online performances allow people who cannot come to the show\u2019s venue to still have fun . For example , during the Covid-19 pandemic , a number of performances from Kpop idols were broadcasted online , satisfying their fans\u2019 need for entertainment . On the other hand , advocates of live performances have grounds to believe that this will be more beneficial to both the artist and the viewer . First , only by watching live can the audience feel the atmosphere of the show , which is a vital factor in a performance\u2019s appeal . Thanks to the crowd effect , people are more likely to gain more satisfaction and delirium compared to watching shows alone at home . A direct effect of this is that people can relieve stress and mental exhaustion at work , while strengthening bonds with their friends when they attend live shows together . As for artists , since a large portion of live shows\u2019 audiences are people who love the atmosphere , therefore , when switching to performing on online platforms , the number of viewers and amount of profit will drop significantly", "Whether young people or seniors are better leaders in organizations has become a heated topic of discussion . In my opinion , even though younger people possess certain qualities for leadership , older people are more likely to succeed in managerial positions . On the one hand , having young leaders can offer organizations certain advantages . First of all , thanks to their open-mindedness , young directors can facilitate more groundbreaking innovations . A prime example of this is the fact that most conglomerates in the technology industry nowadays were founded by young people: Snapchat was introduced by 21-year-old Evan Spiegel; Google was established by the 25-year-old duo - Larry Page and Sergey Brin . Moreover , young leaders are more sensitive to trends , which could be advantageous for the organization\u2019s image . These managers can come up with creative ideas to boost the brand\u2019s popularity and thus establish a firmer position in the market for the company . On the other hand , I contend that organizations will be operated better under the guidance of older leaders . First , as veterans , older managers will enjoy the advantage of experiences . The indication of this is that they will be able to assess the situation more thoroughly and make more informed decisions . For example , most multinational companies now are led by older managers , such as LVMH , which is still guided by 73-year-old Bernard Arnault . Thanks to his rich knowledge , the conglomerate has flourished . Secondly , older leaders are more respected by fellow employees as a result of their seniority . A key to a director\u2019s success is regard and respect from their colleagues and subordinates , and being seniors , older managers enjoy this as a natural advantage , whereas younger leaders have to prove themselves in order to earn respect", "While some people claim that educating the young should be the main concern the world over , others believe that more funds should be allocated to decrease the rate of illiteracy among adults . From my perspective , I side with the latter idea as adult schooling can have positive impacts on the development of countries and individuals . To start with , a decline in the rate of illiterate adults can offer countries strategic economic advantages . First , this will increase the number of high quality laborers in the country , resulting in improved economic growth . As most white-collar positions\u2019 minimum requirement nowadays is the ability to read and write , illiterate adults will have to resort to low-paid work , which means a loss of tax , as well as scarce resources of intellectual workers . Secondly , having a high rate of illiteracy among adults may also lead to heavy burdens on social assistance . During times of crisis , such as the Covid-19 pandemic , illiterate adults are the ones who are most prone to unemployment . The indication of this is that governments will have to provide them monetary assistance , thus , the larger the number of uneducated grown-ups , the more considerable the subsidy . Regarding individuals , being able to read and write can be advantageous to one\u2019s mental health and their offsprings . What illiteracy brings to individuals is low self-esteem . Adults who cannot read nor write often shy away from social interactions , as well as experience a sense of inferiority due to their lack of basic abilities . Moreover , children with illiterate parents often lose their access to education . Since their mothers and fathers often cannot find well-paid jobs that can cover their school fees , these kids have to help their parents make ends meet from an early age , resulting in illiteracy from one generation to the next", "Whether advertisements do not exert any influence on people\u2019s shopping preferences has gained traction . From my perspective , I disagree with this notion as advertisements can have significant effects on shoppers . On the one hand , it is a fact that there are various factors contributing to consumers\u2019 choices of goods and services besides advertising . The four fundamentals of a brand\u2019s success are: product , price , place , and promotion . If a service is overpriced or lacking in quality or not widely available , then despite heavy promotional efforts , that product will not sell well in the market . A prime example is the case of McDonald\u2019s in Vietnam . Despite its rather successful advertisements when it first appeared , after a few years , the brand\u2019s penetration in the Southeast Asia country is considered a flop . McDonald\u2019s unsuccessful venture could be attributed to its dishes , which are costly and unsuitable to the local\u2019s taste . On the other hand , I believe that advertisements have an immeasurable power of impact on shoppers . First , advertisements can educate and guide first-time consumers . To be more specific , in case a buyer has never purchased a product before , the first source of information she has is from advertisements . Thus , while shopping for the product , the topmost name on her mind would be the one with the most frequent promotions . Secondly , advertising can help shift people\u2019s perception of a brand . Consumers , after watching a promotional video over and over again , will start to memorize the product\u2019s benefits subconsciously and associate the product with said advantages . To exemplify , Louis Vuitton launched a collaboration - an advertisement effort - with Supreme in order to appeal to millennials . The partnership was a success as the famed fashion house managed to gain popularity among the demographic whose favor all brands are competing for", "With technological advancements come numerous benefits , one of which being the decrease in crime rate . In my opinion , technology supports law enforcers in restraining and solving criminal activities . First and foremost , nowadays , high-tech gears and programs have helped solve cases faster and more accurately . In case of milder offenses , such as burglary , CCTV cameras can help the police identify the lawbreaker through his captured images , whereas in the past , law enforcers had to rely on memory portraits from witnesses , which could often be inaccurate . For serious felonies , technological advances play an important role in bringing justice to the victims . To illustrate , in Texas , a 35-year-old cold case has just been solved using DNA technology . The 1986 murder was thought to be hopeless as the technology back then did not allow for DNA analysis , yet three decades later , justice was found thanks to innovations in crime science . Another advantage of technological developments is its ability to prevent crimes . What this means is that through the use of technology , crime attempts can be deterred . For example , released convicts will usually be forced to wear a GPS tracking device and be put on a watchlist . Thanks to this , criminals will have to rethink their plans of recidivism as they could be busted easily and sent to jail . Compared to the old days , those who have done their sentences were free to do whatever they wanted , leading to high recidivism rates", "Laws and rules are said to be the building blocks of our society and have brought stability by acting as a solid framework for all citizens to abide by . For this reason , I agree that it is vital that individuals follow these social guidelines . Throughout the course of history , it has been well-proven that laws have bound humans as a community . Laws could be understood as a set of social guidelines that set each person\u2019s responsibility . One case in point are regulations about food safety . At the state and local level , restaurants must follow rules on sanitary food storage and preparation to ensure diner\u2019s safety . At a national level , production plants should be examined by governmental agencies to guarantee that food at markets will be of top quality . Thanks to food safety regulations , the relationship between consumers and service providers will be balanced and indisputable . Moreover , rules and regulations ensure equality for people of all social stratas . When there are no laws , humans can freely do as they please , thus , resulting in discrimination between different classes . That the rich would be favored while the poor would be opposed , and the gap between the well-off and the less fortunate would widen is likely to happen . For example , a famous case of laxed law and order , leading to double standards is the scandal of the Red Bull heir , who was charged with a hit and run but has managed to escape retribution for years . If the criminal was an everyday citizen , he would now be serving his sentence . Thailand\u2019s public was angered and have been demanding for the law to be enforced . In conclusion , when there are no laws and rules , the society would fall into chaos and some of its fundamentals , such as equality , could not be achieved", "Whether adolescents should be punished for their crimes in the way adults are has gained traction . From my point of view , imposing similar punishments for both young and matured offenders will have a negative impact . On the one hand , advocates of equal treatment for underaged and adult lawbreakers have grounds to believe that this notion can have positive results . First , more young criminals would emerge if they are pardoned for their wrongdoings due to their age . Some retributions are too light for the seriousness of the felonies committed , hence , cannot deter youngsters from breaking the law . Moreover , giving young offenders lighter sentences is unjust for the victims and their families , as some felonies are too vile for punishments such as being sent to prison . One case in point is in Vietnam , 2017 , a robber killed a family of 4 , including the parents and their young children . Usually , this man would have been sentenced to death , yet he only got sentenced to 18 years in prison . The fact that he escaped just punishment because he was a few months underaged angered the public for an extended period of time . On the other hand , I strongly believe that juvenile delinquents should not receive retributions similar to that for adults . To start with , children do not have the moral capacity and thorough understanding of the world as grown-ups . Therefore , they cannot fully comprehend the weight of their wrongdoings or even the sentences . Some young offenders commit crimes without knowing that it is an offense . Thus , giving these criminals leeway and an opportunity to rehabilitate and contributing to society is more humane . Furthermore , adolescents are easily affected by different factors , as compared to adults . Grown-ups have the ability to stop themselves but younger ones , once instigated , may act on impulse and cause regrets", "Whether the internet has helped youngsters and workers to fulfill their educational and occupational aims easier than before has become a topic of discussion . In my opinion , I firmly advocate for this idea as the internet has brought many positives to both the young and laborers . To begin with , students can benefit from the internet when it comes to searching for information and storing data . In former times , looking for information can be laborious as one must take ample time leafing through the pages and traveling to public libraries . Nowadays , thanks to the internet , any kind of knowledge is available within just a click of a mouse . Furthermore , students these days can save their assignments on the internet , making it more convenient to share with their classmates for peer review sessions or with their teachers . An example of this is Google Classroom , which can act as a virtual classroom where students can submit assignments and converse with their professors . Moreover , the internet has facilitated smoother communication for workingmen , thus improving their work efficiency . Traditionally , to be employed meant working at an office , yet the internet has allowed workers to converse with their colleagues anywhere and anytime through video conferencing softwares like Zoom and Google Meet . This development means that crises at work can be solved in a timely manner , even though the one in charge may not be present . To illustrate , during the Covid-19 pandemic , online working platforms and video conferencing apps have created a culture of working from home , which has ensured businesses to operate while keeping the employees safe from risk of infection . To conclude , the internet has an irreplaceable position in both the young generation\u2019s education and a person\u2019s professional life", "The notion that raising the cost of fuel for transportation can alleviate environmental issues has been gaining traction . From my point of view , while this solution can help tackle environmental problems to a degree , creating an incentive for individuals and enterprises to take action against these problems would be a more effective approach . On the one hand , an increase in the cost of fuel may prove effective in decreasing the traffic volume , thus reducing harmful emissions that can affect the environment . First , this policy would raise people\u2019s awareness on the frequency and length of their travels . Due to the rise in expenses , people would have to cut down on unnecessary trips . Moreover , as fuel prices soar , more sustainable mobility choices that rely less on carbon-intensive fuels , namely buses that run on biofuel , will witness a surge in demand . To illustrate , in America , since 2010 , hybrid vehicles and smaller transports have had a growing market as a consequence of rising fuel prices . On the other hand , increasing fuel cost cannot tackle all environmental issues . As a matter of fact , car emissions are not the sole cause , but emissions from livestock farming and other industries are also significant contributors to pollution . To illustrate , what is surprising is that livestock accounts for 64 percent of total methane emission - a destructive gas for the ozone layer . Hence , providing individuals and businesses with an incentive to protect the environment would be more effective . For example , the government can apply a lower tax on companies which leave less impact on its surroundings . In this way , enterprises will proactively find ways to reduce their carbon footprint . All in all , increasing fuel prices can help solve environmental problems to a degree", "Whether sports and social facilities should be built by large corporations for the local community has become a topic of discussion . From my viewpoint , I strongly believe that this practice is reasonable and beneficial for both the locals and the businesses . First of all , that large corporations build community facilities would improve the local\u2019s welfare tremendously . Benefits and funds allocated to different areas in a country will vary depending on their economic and political importance . That is why in Vietnam , provinces like Hai Phong are less developed than Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi , thus locals of Hai Phong do not have the chance to experience top-notch facilities as in big cities . Nevertheless , Hai Phong is home to various factories of well-known brands . If these businesses help pay for the construction of sports and recreational facilities in the province , Hai Phong\u2019s citizens would have equal quality of life as Hanoians . Since the government cannot invest uniformly throughout a country , large enterprises building local facilities would be a great help in improving the country\u2019s social welfare . Moreover , providing sports and social facilities for the local community is a way for businesses to fulfill their corporate social responsibility . As a matter of fact , all corporations are bound to give back to the community in one way or another . However , in comparison to doing charities or organizing marathons , providing the community with sports and social facilities would leave a more lasting impact and on a much larger scale . Not only that people from different social classes can make use of the given installations , but these facilities would last for many years to come , reminding the locals of the businesses\u2019 good deeds . In conclusion , it is recommended that large businesses give back to the community by equipping them with sports and social facilities", "Whether the elderly should continue working if their health allows them to do so has become a topic of discussion . In my opinion , I strongly advocate for this idea since it can bring tremendous positives to the elders , businesses , and the society . To begin with , having elders who have passed retirement age at work can relieve pressure on society . Firstly , this can help solve the issue of the declining workforce in many countries with an aging population . By having capable elderly employees , the society is supplied with an additional source of knowledgeable workers . Secondly , older people who continue working can save the government a part of the monthly subsidy for retirees , which can be allocated to build and improve the country\u2019s infrastructure . Retirement benefits vary from country to country but a payment every month for retired workingmen is a common theme . By decreasing the number of elders in the community , the government can cut a huge amount of expenses and this sum can be allocated to the country\u2019s social welfare . Moreover , older people can maintain their mental and physical health by continuing to go to work . After retirement , retirees who live alone often suffer from boredom and loneliness . This can lead to a declining mental health . To solve this issue , letting the elderly join the workforce can help them find joy at work . What is more , businesses can also benefit from this development as they can continue employing experienced employees and cut training costs for newly hired staff who are oftentimes inexperienced at work . In conclusion , having older people who are physically and mentally fit at work is a positive development", "Males are believed to be innately more competitive than females . In my opinion , I completely agree with this statement and this view will be elaborated in this essay . To begin with , males being more aggressive than females can be attributed to evolution . Since the dawn of civilization , males have been hunters and women have been gatherers . While men hunted for food and protected the tribes from danger , women took on more domestic tasks and cared for infants and those that were weak . As a result , males developed to be more combative in order to fight off predators or enemies , and females grew to be more nurturing . Overtime , these became inherited traits for both genders in later generations . To exemplify , a study conducted in the United States in 2007 pointed out that women accounted for merely 2 . 5 percent of the highest paid executives . What caused this includes a lack of female leaders in the most competitive positions , among other reasons . Moreover , women naturally have less desire for competition than men due to their roles in the patriarchal society . Throughout the course of human history , patriarchy has been dominating . In former times , women were forced to take a back seat in most aspects . These days , this practice is deprecated , yet taboos towards competitive women still exist . For example , at the workplace , if a woman is openly ambitious , her actions are likely to be frowned upon . As a result , in nature , women are less confident than men in pursuing their goals and often shy away from competition as they are convinced that their achievements are undesirable and that they have less chance of winning", "Whether economic growth in a well-off country would increase its citizens\u2019 satisfaction has become a topic of discussion . In my opinion , I agree that while there is a limit to what money can bring , an increase in a country\u2019s economic situation would always delight the people . First , economic wealth is only a part of life satisfaction , therefore , it can only please people to an extent . From my point of view , there is a limitation of material possessions that a person could hoard . Most people only need a roof over their head , food and money that are used to pay for other necessities . Therefore , once these needs are fulfilled , a surplus of other properties is no longer desirable . Additionally , a person\u2019s satisfaction is not made of economic wealth alone but also of their well-being and relationships . To be more specific , a person could be the richest , yet if he were to suffer from a prolonged illness , he would not achieve true satisfaction . On the other hand , I believe that however prosperous a country is , additional economic growth would always appease its citizens . There are aspects that only a nation\u2019s monetary reserve can solve , thus , the larger the reserve becomes , the more problems it can tackle . Take road infrastructure for example , even if a person drives the most expensive car but the road is bumpy , he would not be able to fully enjoy the experience . In these cases , a country\u2019s economic wealth is important since more money equals better infrastructure . Furthermore , an abundance of possessions will lead to advancements in technology and healthcare . These in turn will benefit its citizens beyond materialistic satisfaction", "It has been argued in the past that since it is not possible to help the whole of the world\u2019s population , national governments should only lend their assistance to citizens within their jurisdiction . I only agree with this view , since while I believe that governments can only effectively and legitimately exercise their power over their own population , it would nonetheless be in their interest to support weaker states . \ufeff It could be said that governments can only effectively govern in a certain geographical area . If a population is too large , or if jurisdictions overlap , there could be confusion as to which government\u2019s authority applies . This is why countries today try to have clearly defined borders , in order for the government to focus on governing only the people enclosed within it . Further , it would also be cost-inefficient for a government to help other people across their borders - the job might better be left for their national government , who is more attuned to the needs and demands of the citizens . Nonetheless , it might conversely be argued that some richer countries should still have some responsibility to assist poorer and weaker governments who cannot govern themselves . This could produce goodwill between countries and promote international cooperation . Furthermore , by helping countries that cannot effectively govern , this reduces the possibility that there will be refugees as a result of political instability or war . For instance , the reason why aid is given to developing countries in South America by the United States is to make the countries more stable and to reduce immigration into the latter country", "Whether people should be held responsible for their own local environment protection by the government has become a topic of discussion . From my point of view , I firmly support this idea for a number of reasons . First , because human self-discipline is often unreliable , suitable punishments from the government are necessary . To be more specific , if people are left to protect the environment of their own volition , efforts may vary between different communities since having an equal understanding of our habitat\u2019s importance throughout the community is impossible . For example , all tourist attractions nowadays have to impose a fine on those who litter , because once such a rule is not in effect , all sites will be filled with trash left behind by ignorant tourists . In Ha Long Bay , Vietnam , due to a lack of guards , the world-renowned heritage site is blighted with trash floating on the water surface . Another point is that , through educational efforts , governments holding people accountable for their actions in the local environment can help raise awareness effectively . Most people nowadays have a fear of missing out so once a green lifestyle is advocated strongly , it will soon spread widely . Take the inox straw trend for example , the movement started by a group of environmentalists was picked up by large beverage companies and has now become one of the most profitable businesses the world over . The same effect may not be achieved if the movement was a policy implemented by the government . Furthermore , initiatives can be taken to prompt individuals to make small changes such as reducing the frequency of their travels , which can help reduce the overall carbon footprint . To sum up , the government making people responsible towards their own environment is indisputable", "People have different views about whether or not extinction of animal species is a natural phenomenon , and preventing this process is pointless . From my perspective , I am completely against this notion for a number of reasons . First of all , humans are partly responsible for various disappearances of animal species . While many wild beasts went extinct from natural causes , a greater proportion of species are on the verge of extinction or no longer extant as a result of human activities . Mass deforestation to build infrastructure or for timber harvesting has cost wild animals their living habitats , leading to food sources depletion and eventually , death . To illustrate , Australia's recent wildfires have pushed around 100 species closer to extinction . Hunting is another notorious cause for the dwindling of animals\u2019 population as many species such as rhinos or elephants are hunted for their body parts . For example , the African Black Rhinos are no longer in existence for being hunted for their horns . Another point is that preventing animals from being extinct is critical to our ecosystem . The loss of animal species could disrupt our ecosystem\u2019s balance . Since all living organisms\u2019 lives in a habitat are interrelated , once a species succumbs to extinction , other animals that depend on it will be affected and eventually disappear . This will lead to the lack of diversity and can also cause potential damage to our economy . For example , in 2013 , the sunflower starfish in Northern California declined in number due to a disease , thus causing its prey - the purple sea urchins to flourish . This sudden proliferation has damaged the red urchins\u2019 population and also exhausted a great source of sushi , which resulted in a slump in the area\u2019s economy . To summarize , the process of animal extinction has been escalated by human activities such as hunting and deforestation", "Many people argue that as one of the world\u2019s major industries , international tourism has facilitated cross-cultural understanding . However , some claim that this sector has paved the way for tensions to arise . From my point of view , I side with the view that international tourism helps promote peace rather than dispute between nations . To start with , international travel allows interracial understanding and friendship between nations to flourish . By experiencing life in other parts of the world and taking a closer look into the locals\u2019 mindset through their cuisines and traditions , foreigners can respect and sympathize with the natives more . Furthermore , most hate starts from fear of the unknown . When people do not understand another race , they start to believe in false preconceptions , thus shunning people who do not share the same root with them . Through international tourism , this bias can be erased since people are given a glimpse into other cultures and it can help correct existing prejudices . On the other hand , it is unfortunate that international travel , if done with ignorance , can create disputes between people from different countries . Every country the world over has their own customs and superstitions , therefore it is important to learn what the locals believe in . If a traveler does not conduct any research then it is very likely that the traveler can unintentionally offend the local values , thus causing conflicts to arise . Take the \u201cOK\u201d sign as an example , it is one of the most common gestures throughout the world , yet its meaning varies between nations . While in America , the \u201cOK\u201d sign equals something positive and good , in Iran , it is an insult . In conclusion , I strongly believe that international tourism can foster cross-cultural understanding rather than tensions due to its contribution in removing false preconceptions", "Whether warnings should replace legal punishments in certain cases has become a topic of debate . From my viewpoint , I firmly advocate the idea that minor offenses and first-time offenders can be diverted from prosecution . On the one hand , it is undeniable that punishments are imperative in some instances . First , punishments are efficacious in upholding the legal system . By instilling fear of retribution in potential criminals , punishments help dissuade wrongdoings , thus ensuring security for the society . Secondly , punishments are just desserts for re-offenders . This is because they were well-aware of the consequences of their crimes , yet they decided to fall back into old habits . For these recidivists , education alone would be insufficient while stronger punitive measures should be imposed . On the other hand , diverting first-time and minor offenders from prosecution has some positives in preventing crimes . Firstly , diversion will save legal enforcers time and effort . Sometimes , trivial cases such as shoplifting will get low-level penalties even if they are brought to court . Therefore , by giving out notices for minor offences , the police can allot more time for more serious crimes . Furthermore , rehabilitative measures can have positive impacts on reducing crime rates . Sometimes , people who break laws are unintentional , in these cases , proper education is appropriate . For instance , a research conducted in London in 2015 has proven that those cautioned were 50 percent less likely to reoffend as compared to those who were fined by a court . Moreover , warnings give young adults a greater chance to grow out of crime , since having a clean record will open them up to many job opportunities instead of resorting to crime to make a living", "These days , the fact that some celebrities are known for their money rather than for what they have achieved has become a hotly debated topic . In my opinion , I believe that these celebrities are bad influences for young people . Nevertheless , there are many other stars who are good examples to adolescents . First of all , many celebrities are well-known for their glamorous lifestyle , which does not come from hard work . These celebrities may achieve fame and wealth from their parents , partners , families , or from being scandalous . This can mislead youngsters to believe that success can be achieved through unconventional means and give them a twisted perspective on life\u2019s values . Take the Kardashians for example , they build an empire of reality shows from showing their quarrels , infidelities , and partying - which are not healthy behaviours that children should learn . On the other hand , there are various self-made celebrities with admirable qualities and achievements that can influence young people in a positive way . These stars work their way up with talents , work ethics , and kind personalities . Such celebrities will inspire children to work hard and behave appropriately . For example , Keanu Reeves is an internationally famous star who is also widely known for his humble characteristic and good deeds . One of which is that he gave 70 percent of his earnings from the first \u201cThe Matrix\u201d movie to leukemia studies . Another well-known star is Emma Watson , who became a millionaire after her role in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise . Despite becoming well-off at a young age , Emma never neglected her studies and even graduated from an Ivy-League school . In conclusion , even though there are stars who exert negative influence on young people , there are several other celebrities who are exemplary to youngsters in the way they live their lives", "The fact that sporting events have become a fertile ground for advertisements has become a hot topic for debate , with many arguing that this trend affects the sports industry negatively . From my perspective , I partly disagree with the statement . To begin with , sports events being used as a platform for promotion can offer both the events and the sports team tremendous benefits . Firstly , advertising can help cover the event planning costs and make the events more accessible . Internationally-acclaimed sporting competitions can cost the host countries an astronomical amount of money that without sponsorships from large corporations , would not be paid off unless the entrance ticket is high-priced . This would drive fans away and hurt the event\u2019s profit . For example , the 2021 Tokyo Olympics game is reported to have generated 2 . 25 billion US dollars in advertising revenue , which is almost 20 percent of the hosting cost . Secondly , advertisements can give sportsmen a better living standard , thus helping them take their mind off money problems and focus on the games . Some players even got rich thanks to product endorsements , namely Ronaldo and Messi Nevertheless , promoting products during sporting events can bring about negative consequences if the product is not ethical . As sports stars are influential figures , sports teams should be careful about what products they can endorse . To be more specific , research from Yale University in 2013 claimed that some sports sponsorships that featured junk food had increased the rate of child obesity . This is because children are impressionable , therefore , once they see famous athletes with fast food , they can have the wrong impression that this kind of food is wholesome and develop cravings for junk food", "It is argued that the authority should be the one which conducts and manages scientific studies . While certain benefits can be derived from governmental control of scientific research , I would believe that private organizations are a better candidate for such essential research . Admittedly , there are some good reasons why the government should be in charge of carrying out and controlling scientific research . Firstly , the government has the budget from national taxes that can support scientists and researchers . Thus , the company in charge would receive money to complete their work without worrying about the depletion of resources . Secondly , some independent companies only look for profits , which makes it extremely dangerous . For example , a company may discover a chemical that can make biological weapons , and they may sell it to an antisocial party in Pakistan; this is certainly harmful to almost all human beings . However , despite some arguments above , I am of the opinion that private firms would do the research mentioned above much better . Firstly , non-governmental companies usually pay a huge amount of money for their staff; this helps them attract more talented and skillful scientists to work for them . As a result , scientific studies and papers conducted by these organizations are likely to be more accurate . Secondly , unlike the authority that has many aspects to take care of , independent firms often concentrate on only one to two fields , which helps to yield auspicious results . For example , MCG , which is a medical company in Binh Duong , only concentrates on two particular fields that are researching and manufacturing new medicines , which makes it better than other governmental companies in Vietnam", "In response to the alarmingly high rate of traffic accidents , some people think that we should increase the legal driving age . Although I think this solution can be somewhat beneficial , it is not effective in general . Firstly , lifting the legal driving age will increase pressure on public transport systems and parents to accommodate this sudden surplus of people without a driving license . For example , raising the driving age from 18 to 21 means tens of thousands of people will not be able to drive . As a result , more buses , taxis , and other urban public transport means must be put into use , or parents will have to continue driving their children around . Secondly , the most common causes of traffic accidents are drinking while driving and driving in the wrong lanes . These have little to do with the legal driving age but more with driving etiquette . Therefore , increasing the legal driving age could do more harm than good for society . However , I can also understand why some people would advocate for this idea . Firstly , by lifting the minimum driving age , driving schools will have more time to educate young adults on road safety , leading to future generations driving more carefully . For example , currently , if you want to get a driving license , most people do not attend a driving school . They only need to take a quiz and a driving test . That certainly can be improved . Secondly , it is evident that some traffic accidents also occur due to immature decisions , such as hosting races or riding a motorbike with more than two people . Lifting the minimum age can help to reduce these short-sighted behaviors", "The question of whether emergencies or positive stories should be featured on the news have been a recent topic of debate . Many believe we should try to focus on issues and situations of negative stories , whilst others believe that constant exposure to darker content on the news would cause people to turn away from news altogether . Personally , I believe that the news should maintain a balance of both positive and negative stories . On the one hand , depressing or upsetting news might turn people away from watching them entirely , leading to a large contingent of people being under-informed . This is something cable news and traditional print media have failed to solve , as they prefer to maintain a pessimistic , sensationalist style of reporting in order to increase revenue . As a result , there has also been a recent sharp increase in , for example , the number of American youths who get their news through comedic news shows , as an effort to offset the gravity of the situations we are faced with every day . On the other hand , it can be argued that focusing on ignoring negative issues will not make them go away , and informing the people of their existence might lead to better solutions . Countries and societies constantly need to change to adapt to pressing problems , and only by informing its citizens and involving them in the decision making process can solutions be found . For example , the prospect of a climate catastrophe is gloomy , however , if there was no coverage on it , it could be judged that there would not have been as many environmental movements as there are today", "During the initial phases of urban design , some believe that public parks and sports facilities should take priority over shopping centres as a means of citizens\u2019 recreation . Personally , I believe a mixture of both should be incorporated in order to generate revenue and ensure the wellbeing of the general populace . Firstly , whilst it should never be the main goal of a town , it is important for urban centers to generate revenue through shopping centres in order to fund infrastructure projects and maintain existing buildings . This would not be possible with the development of free public parks or sports facilities alone , for shopping centres bring in jobs and create tax revenue in ways that public recreational projects cannot . Many people travel to Bangkok , for instance , in order to shop high quality goods at a cheap price - prioritizing public parks over this would cost the country an underdeveloped tourism industry , making a dent in the country\u2019s main source of income . On the other hand , it is not enough to merely aim to generate revenue , and it should be spent on something that benefits the general populace , like public facilities that are free to use and that encourage wellbeing overall . Public parks have multiple health benefits such as helping cardiovascular health and improving mental health . Furthermore , public facilities may encourage tourists to visit , increasing revenue as they partake in the town\u2019s services . This is why a city such as London , despite being very industrial , still contains large parks in order to help preserve the wellbeing of its inhabitants", "Today , more and more parents are sending their kids to study abroad , leading to the question of whether study-abroad students are beneficial to their home country . Although I strongly agree that there are benefits to the home country , I also think there are downsides . There are two main reasons why I think the government should welcome students who choose to pursue education in another country . Firstly , it is a fact that there are lots of prestigious educational institutions around the world that Vietnamese students can attend . This means that these students can grow to their fullest potentials , then return to Vietnam with this knowledge and help to develop the country in multiple aspects . Secondly , going abroad will help equip students with new perspectives and lifestyles , which benefits the home country . For example , students who come back from the US will usually be more open-minded and proactive in their workplace . As a result , they will gradually change the work culture for the better . However , that is not to say that the home country would always benefit from study-abroad students . The first reason is that there is an alarming portion of students who do not return home after being abroad . Many reasons can explain this phenomenon , such as the home country does not offer a stable enough career prospect , or that the pay is not high enough , but one thing for sure is that this leads to brain drain . The second reason is that students can be out of touch with the social scene in their home country after studying abroad . As a result , fresh graduates may find it difficult to blend in at work . For example , most abroad students are ignorant of social movements happening in their home countries and often are not engaged in conversations at work with these topics . In conclusion , I strongly agree that the benefits that study-abroad students bring to their home country are undeniable", "There are many who argue that if a product adequately meets the demands of customers , there is no need for a company to promote it through advertising . In this essay , I seek to argue that I overall disagree with this sentiment , since advertising can create differentiation from other products or promote certain lifestyles , which in the end increases products\u2019 attractiveness to consumers . On the one hand , it could be argued that advertising might not be necessary for certain special products as word of mouth might be enough to increase its sales , given that it fulfills customer needs . Those who have tried a unique product and are satisfied with it might voluntarily recommend it to their friends and colleagues . This is , for instance , how many companies operating in niche markets operate , as their consumer base is too small for mass advertising campaigns to be effective . Furthermore , it could also be said that in the internet age , potential consumers can simply search the internet for products that are congruent with their needs . For example , restaurants in a small area might not need to advertise to local inhabitants , since they can simply search on Google Maps and find the restaurants themselves . On the other hand , one might contend that advertising is still necessary beyond showcasing the functionality of a product . In markets where there are many different brands for the same type of item , advertising can be the element which can help a customer make their final decision . For instance , although Coca Cola and Pepsi are functionally quite similar (i . e . they are both soft drinks) , both brands still spend billions on advertising a year in order to make themselves seem unique . In addition , advertising could also be useful in associating a product with a certain lifestyle . For example , advertisements by perfume brands such as Hugo Boss often depict a luxurious way of living that can be obtained upon buying their product - this means that the consumer is buying the product not only for its functional value but the perception around it . In conclusion , I argue that while for some small companies , advertising would be an unnecessary financial burden since their customer base is small enough that this would not be necessary", "With the current migration trend from the countryside to metropolitan areas , people are starting to wonder if city life has many advantages over countryside life . I think that living in the cities is more beneficial , especially for young adults . There are many reasons why I believe that living in the city is more beneficial . Firstly , metropolitan areas are job hubs for a wide variety of industries , which is why young professionals migrate here . For example , Ho Chi Minh City has many multinational companies in fields ranging from technology to marketing with great demands for workers . Secondly , the urban lifestyle offers multiple entertainment options for young adults and educational facilities for their children . Big cities usually host an extensive range of public events , like festivals , concerts , exhibitions , or sports events , where couples can go on their weekends . Their children would also benefit from a diverse education provided by many English institutions , sports clubs , and art centers . However , that is not to say that life in the countryside is at a disadvantage . Firstly , it is apparent that pollution issues are drastically better in the suburbs and rural areas . For example , because there are not as many vehicles in the countryside , there are fewer exhaust fumes , which leads to significantly cleaner air . Fewer factories also mean water and soil contamination problems are better . Secondly , a lower living cost is also why many still want to stay in the suburbs . Housing prices in the suburbs are tremendously less than those in the cities , and average rents have the same trend . Also , because most produce comes from the countryside , if one eats locally , the grocery cost is reduced", "With the growing trend of globalization , more tourists from all over the world are spending their vacations in Vietnam . This has led to some thinking that this trend has a negative impact overall . I strongly disagree with this idea , thinking that international traveling is beneficial to the countries visited . I disagree with the statement because international travels foster the tourism industry of Vietnam . For example , for many tourist attractions , local people rely heavily on tourism to make their living . Foreign tourists are typically more generous as they spend more on food , souvenirs , and activities like canoeing or zip-lining . Another reason why I disagree is that , because of foreign travelers , more restoration of Vietnamese culture gets carried out . Foreign tourists are more interested in traditional festivals , clothes , and buildings than domestic ones . By encouraging foreigners to visit Vietnam , we have the incentives to preserve our traditions , especially when foreigners appreciate them . However , I can understand why some people have a negative attitude towards foreign tourists . The first reason is that foreigners sometimes can have little respect for the environment of the country they traveled to . It can be seen , usually , after vacations , that visitors from some countries would typically litter all over the beaches , like Vung Tau or Nha Trang . The second reason is that the greater the influx of international tourists , the less domestic tourists can enjoy themselves . For example , Hoi An is always packed with tourists from South Korea and China all year round , making it extremely difficult for domestic tourists to enjoy any activities here . This problem is considered the tradeoff between prioritizing international or domestic tourists . In conclusion , I do agree that international travelers can cause problems for the countries they visit", "In today\u2019s competitive economy , many believe that one needs to be knowledgeable in maths in order to excel in business . While I believe that maths is indeed an important element to any worker\u2019s skill set , I argue that it is not vital to the success of an individual; this is because whether maths is important is dependent both on the business and the position the employee or employer holds . It is apparent that mathematical ability has increasingly been sought out by employers as a sign that the employee will succeed within a business . This proficiency in maths not only allows individuals to analyse large quantities of data , it also demonstrates the ability to think critically . Therefore , those who are talented at maths can not only help businesses predict future trends and stay one step ahead of their opponents , they might be able to assist in logistics or administrative tasks as well . This is why for example why top financial institutions and technology companies , such as Goldman Sachs and Tesla , often pay premiums in order to recruit the top mathematicians from prestigious universities . However , it could also be argued that the most successful businessmen might not need to be well versed in mathematics , since they can simply employ employees who are . Many managers and CEOs simply do not have time to do every single calculation that involves their business , and instead focus their time on managing relationships and communicating with people . It could be said that their function is thus not to manage the business , but to manage people - their role is to find and bring out the best in people that can perform jobs better than them through specialization", "Because video games are becoming more popular with children than ever , many parents express their worries about whether or not their children should spend time outdoors instead of playing games . I believe that video games are good , but only in moderation . Engaging in outdoor activities is always good for children for various reasons . Outdoor activities are better than video games for both their physical health and morals . Playing video games means looking at high-contrast screens for an extended period , which is damaging to children\u2019s eyes . Also , today\u2019s games involve blatant violence , which can distort their moral beliefs . Secondly , doing outdoor activities is a way to connect with their neighborhood . For example , when hanging outdoors , like playing soccer , children can develop their communication skills between their playmates and a sense of belonging with that community . However , that is not to say that video games are not important for child development . Firstly , video games teach children technology fluency , which is a skill essential in the current society . For example , many children who play video games grow up being familiar with computer hardware and keyboard shortcuts . These skills would come in handy for them in the future . Secondly , I believe parents should not prevent children from playing video games as these games can serve as career inspirations . For example , children can be interested in the storyline or the graphic design of games and be motivated to become pro-gamers or game developers . In conclusion , the benefits of hanging outdoors are undeniable for child development . However , I believe that , in some cases , allowing children to engage in video games can also be important", "Whether written or oral is a more powerful form of communication has long been a subject of debate . Personally , I argue that neither of the forms could be said to be superior since there are nuances that can only be conveyed through either the spoken or written medium . On the one hand , speeches have always been used as the primary method of addressing large masses of people , for they are more effective at conveying feelings of passion and excitement . Speakers , by lowering and increasing the volume of their voice , can alter the energy of an audience that writers cannot do as easily through the written word . It is no mistake that every political leader conveys their ideas and inspires their people through speeches: successful politicians of the past , such as Obama or Tony Blair , were also great orators who can excite a crowd? On the other hand , the separation and impartiality of the written form allow the medium to paint more colorful and detailed worlds . The impersonal nature of writing also allows the written form to convey things that would be rejected through the spoken word , and engage in darker , more mature content that provokes the mind . This is why many people still read books since they help to paint a more vivid picture of the subject , they are trying to convey . Due to the added layer of engagement required in reading rather than listening , the reader can discover worlds more in-depth then we would the listener", "There is an ongoing debate about whether a person is successful or not has everything to do with luck . I strongly oppose this statement for various reasons . Firstly , this belief is not entirely accurate in multiple ways . Many people believe that natural talent , which is a form of luck , that makes a person successful . However , there is only so much that innate talent can do for you if hard work is not present . For example , students who are extremely bright kids score poorly on the college entrance exam or do not contribute to anything significant in their careers . Moreover , many people think luck plays a role in helping people build their connections . However , I believe that partnerships and opportunities come only to those who genuinely put effort into maintaining that connection or grasping that opportunity . For example , there are multiple encounters that a person has in their lives , but to turn those encounters into personal relationships depends on one\u2019s communication skills . Secondly , even if luck does play a part in one\u2019s success , believing that success relates to it can be dangerous . People who have this mindset tend to beat themselves up all the time or procrastinate in accomplishing their goals . Because they think everything correlates with luck , they will blame themselves for not being destined to gain success or spend time waiting for the perfect moment . Moreover , people who believe in this correlation also downplay others\u2019 achievements . For example , many people tend to disregard others\u2019 hard work or efforts the moment they find out that those people come from a rich background or are naturally gifted . In conclusion , I oppose the statement that whether or not a person can achieve their goals depends on luck", "Some people believe that in order for students to learn a new language or culture , they must move to another country . I partially agree with this opinion , since although I believe that going to a country allows individuals to submerge themselves in that culture , it is still possible to read about languages and cultures through the internet or talking to people from a certain country . It could be said that given the ease of access to information today mediated by the internet , it is actually possible for individuals to learn about another country\u2019s history and language purely through sitting at home . Furthermore , given the interconnected nature of today\u2019s countries , it is likely that people would be able to find immigrants from the country whose language they are trying to learn . For instance , there have been many cases of polyglots such as Tim Doner being able to speak as many as twenty languages purely through speaking to people around the US . However , it might also be contended that to fully understand the richness and nuances of a country\u2019s language and culture , it would be worthwhile to travel to that country . This is because although the internet is a useful tool , the subtlety of human interactions might not be conveyed through online pictures and videos alone . Furthermore , immigrants in other countries might also not speak the same version of the language from their host country . For instance , it is often the case that the textbook version of a language , which one might be able to learn from the internet , is very different to how normal people speak , with slang words and other cultural references . Therefore , to appreciate the latter , a change of location is warranted", "With the advancement of technology , many people postulate that since computers are so good at translating languages , people should not learn foreign languages anymore . However , I strongly disagree with this statement due to various reasons . The first reason is that computers cannot help people entirely , especially when they are communicating verbally . In a fast-paced conversation involving multiple technical jargon , computers can have difficulties translating that in time for speakers . That is why in international conferences , such as the United Nations summit , there are interpreters for every single representative . These interpreters are there instead of computers because they have background knowledge of the topics discussed and generally have a higher accuracy when the conversation is fast-paced and delivered in a heavy accent . The second reason is that , even with future advances in technology , computers will never be able to deliver emotions and humor to users . For example , puns are unique to the language that they are spoken and cannot be translated without having to explain extensively . Another point to consider is words with connotations . For example , the slight difference between \u201cthrifty\u201d and \u201cstingy\u201d can sometimes be ignored by machines as they often go for the nearest synonyms . In conclusion , although technology has aided in translation by much , it can never replace multilingual speakers", "It is a common fact that computer games are a ubiquitous part of most teens\u2019 lives . However , most parents think this is harmful because they have little educational value . I strongly disagree with this idea and think that computer games are generally beneficial for teenagers . Despite my view , I can understand why many parents have these concerns . Firstly , spending too much time playing computer games causes various health problems . For example , staring at a screen for extended periods leads to eyestrain and headaches , or even playing video games too late at night can disrupt players' circadian rhythm . Secondly , there is no doubt that video games are addictive . There have been multiple cases where students dropped out of school , cut ties with friends and families , or even resort to crimes to continue to play games . As a result , parents should oversee their children\u2019s relationship with gaming to intervene when needed . However , I do think that playing video games will do more good than harm for teenagers , especially with moderation . The first benefit is that teenagers can enhance multiple skills through computer games , such as better hand-eye coordination , problem-solving skills , or even communication skills . These skills are hard to train in any other way aside from gaming . The second benefit is that playing video games is a great way for gamers to discover whether or not they want to pursue a career in game design . Teenagers can become interested in writing the storyline , designing the costume , or tweaking the graphics when playing games . In conclusion , although there are some drawbacks of playing video games excessively , I think that video games are a great way to train multiple skills at once while serving as a way for people to explore their interests in game design", "In defining society , many insist that it consists of rules and laws , and would not be able to function if individuals were to operate without restrictions . I agree with this view , and believe that although society should allow individuals a level of autonomy , an effective legal system is necessary for a well functioning society , and ensure the safety of the general population . On the one hand , I believe that a level of autonomy is necessary for a society to flourish . Individual freedom allows the whole of society to move forward - by each person doing what he or she wants to a certain extent (so long as it does not harm others) , society can benefit from greater creativity and flexibility . Furthermore , this would also improve the state of civil society , since individuals would be able to debate one another on issues that concern their common governance , and as such make place for a healthier democracy . This is for example , the case in Western Europe , where a more individualist societal set up has created the longest surviving democracies and richest countries in the world . On the other hand , one could also rightly point that no man exists as an island , and that individuals are connected within a society through a set of laws . These rules not only ensure that individuals do not exploit one another , it also sets the expectations for societal interactions - this standardization of behaviour allows people to treat each other with a degree of similarity and upholds societal stability , which could be said to be sorely lacking from an archaic society . For instance , in areas of war , where societal trust has broken down , we can see that individuals are much more skeptical of one another", "The widespread access to information and resources available in order to learn a musical instrument today could be said to be unparalleled; however , there is an intense debate around whether or not every child should be made to undergo musical training , or if it should be left to the child to decide what they want to do . In my opinion , teaching children to play musical instruments should not be superimposed , and that parents should develop the skills that most align with a child\u2019s interest . One side of the argument is that learning how to play a musical instrument from an earlier age could unlock more doors for children in the future . In today\u2019s competitive world , universities are increasingly looking at not only academic abilities but also candidates\u2019 extracurricular activities in order to assess their applications . As such , being able to fluently play a musical instrument would be a great addition to a child\u2019s future CV and allow them access to better opportunities . For instance , statistics for schools like Harvard University show that while every person applying would be academically talented , what differentiates successful applicants are things such as musical and sports achievements . On the other hand , forcing children to learn a musical instrument might be a waste of time if they do not truly enjoy it . This is because not only would the child not pursue a musical interest later in life , but making the investment to teach them an instrument be in vain , there is also an opportunity cost to not teaching them something else they are interested in . All individuals can be said to be different , and not everyone can (or want to) become a musician . Thus , I argue parents should pay attention to what their children aspire to be and assist them in that instead", "As interest around interplanetary travel starts to pique , many are proposing the idea that money be poured into studying other planets . In my opinion , despite this being a worthwhile endeavour , it should not be done at the expense of people on Earth as well as its habitats . One side of the argument is that space is the final frontier for human exploration , and it can provide intellectual satisfaction for individuals . I argue that one of humanity\u2019s most basic drives is the want to be able to explore new phenomena . Human conceptual and linguistic capabilities point to a high level of inquisitiveness and self expression , and as such , space travel could be a potential avenue for expressing these drives . This is why , for instance , despite it not necessarily being profitable , organisations such as NASA continue to spend billions of dollars a year in helping to develop space travel . Thus , if we are able to reduce costs enough for people to live on Mars , this will allow a new generation of humans to learn more about the universe and our place within it . On the other hand , it could be said that space exploration should not be at the cost of the Earth\u2019s health . Instead of spending money on travelling to other planets that could harbour life , I argue that it is much more important to protect the planet we are sure to contain life , that of our own . Thus , resources that are used for space travel could instead be redirected to things such as poverty alleviation programs", "Fewer people are currently engaging with news , as they believe news is no longer relevant to their day to day life . In my opinion , this is the wrong way to think , for watching the news is beneficial to a country\u2019s social and democratic life . Firstly , uninformed citizens who do not watch the news can often make bad political decisions . A well informed populace that watches what is happening in the world , on the other hand , can help formulate policy that benefits society , for they are able to appreciate the intricate nuances that comes with any political decision . Switzerland\u2019s ability to implement policies based on direct democracy , for example , has been reliant upon a populace that keeps up with current events . This model has worked well in the past , and provides testament to the benefits of a large population being politically informed . Secondly , reading the news also allows people to become more sociable , for it allows more things for people to talk and debate about . More specifically , by knowing more about what is\u00a0happening about the world , individuals can talk to their friends on specific news items and its impacts . The prevalence of news in our daily conversations means that they are yet to be obsolete , and will only be more important over time as the world expands and there are more stories to be explored . This is one of the reasons why national news media such as the BBC in the UK is such a cherished institution , for it helps to stimulate conversation and lively debates", "As a medium of art , there are many who believe that film is inferior to literature and paintings in terms of importance . In my opinion , this is demonstrably false , given how much film is a crucial part of pop culture today . On the one hand , it could be argued that literature and paintings have been a form of societal expression for many societies for decades , and as such , can be considered more important to them . Films in contrast might be said to be quite a recent invention , and therefore , the richness and diversity of the industry is incomparable to the other two forms of art . Furthermore , it might also be argued that literature and paintings provide more details to the viewer . This is why , for instance , there is a widespread pattern that books are often better than their movie adaptations , since the latter fail to provide the intricacies of the former . On the other hand , it could be said that films contain elements that other mediums do not have , and as such , are more suitable for certain forms of artistic expression . Therefore , films could be said to be more culturally relevant today , in the age of the internet , where complex forms of media can easily be transmitted . For instance , while music and sounds can be incorporated into films , setting off a number of emotions in the viewers , the same cannot be done with literature or paintings . Furthermore , certain ways of writing a script or shooting a scene might be akin to literature or paintings themselves", "With the prevalence of the Internet , many people think that people do not need to travel to other countries to understand life there . I neither fully agree nor disagree with this opinion . Why I partially agree with this statement is because people can watch documentaries online to understand how life is in foreign countries . These documentaries are often accurate and delivered with great quality , helping the audience understand the foreign cultures better . For example , Netflix recently has released a popular series depicting street food worldwide . Moreover , this option is suitable for those who have yet to be capable of international flights or people who only want a slight experience of multiple countries . For example , if a student is writing a paper on the difference between Asian cultures , he or she has to research online instead of traveling to said countries . However , I partially disagree with the statement because mere research on the Internet cannot replace the traveling experience . Firstly , many features are exaggerated on camera for attention , whether that exaggeration is on the positive or negative side . For example , many foreigners usually film themselves eating bizarre foods from that country , leading viewers to misinterpret that most local people eat that way daily . Secondly , the Internet is full of unverifiable information , so information from Youtube channels or blogs might not be adequate to build a deep understanding of other cultures . In conclusion , I do agree that using the Internet to learn about life in foreign countries instead of traveling is a feasible option for those who cannot afford the travel or do not have enough time", "There is currently a debate surrounding whether the government should redirect funds from art to education . In my opinion , the two are not mutually exclusive , and the state should support the arts since it is a form of education . On the one hand , it could be argued that compared to other disciplines such as the sciences , art generates less economic value to society , and thus more funds should instead go to long run investments . Education is one such example , since a well educated workforce is more likely to attract foreign direct investments , helping to improve employment and tax revenue for the country in the future . Thus , it is understandable as to why growing countries such as China and Vietnam have spent such a large proportion of their budget to improve literacy rates in the country in order to ramp up their competitiveness . On the other hand , it might be said that art can be a form of education with regards to a country\u2019s culture , history and expression . Therefore , although it might generate less profit , arts contribute to a sense of social cohesion and general wellbeing . Without art and culture , I argue that people resemble more of machines: atomised , and with no real place within society . Thus , places like art museums are crucial to upholding society , and without them , people might have less to look forward to after a day of work", "Many philosophers of the past and the present have advocated for living in the moment instead of focusing on the future; in this essay , I hope to show how this is a flawed view , since one should ideally focus on both . Proponents of living in the present argue that stressing about what is ahead of us robs us of the joy of living in the moment . This is a line of reasoning that is , for example , intrinsic to Buddhist philosophy , which states that given society\u2019s current focus on future productivity and output , it is important to find joy in day to day activities . By worrying too much about the future , one could argue that one can never truly achieve happiness , since as soon as a person gets what he or she wants , they immediately jump to what they would need next . Overall , it could be said that given our limited time on Earth , it is indeed a waste to spend it purely living in the future . On the other hand , it is important to plan out what an individual should do in the future in order to ensure a certain level of financial stability . Although it is important to enjoy the moment , not having a clear future plan could result in one becoming poor , ending up in situations they might not necessarily want to be in . Additionally , planning for the future can also give one peace of mind , since not knowing what could potentially happen can lead to anxiety , ruining present enjoyment . Therefore , in order to have both , we should ensure that our future plans are in place", "As money poured into medical treatment research continues to climb around the world , questions are cropping up with regards to whether individuals , private companies or governments should take the brunt of the costs . In my opinion , this should primarily be the job of governments instead of individuals as corporate entities , since the latter\u2019s profit incentive could potentially be dangerous to human lives . There are those who believe that the private sector should fund medical research , since they not only have the funds , but also an economic reason to provide top of the range medical treatment . Most medical research is done by pharmaceutical or healthcare providers , which could help them develop more cutting edge technologies aimed at helping people with both common and rare diseases . In return , these companies can get profits as a reward for their innovativeness , which can in turn be spent on R&D , thus repeating the positive cycle . On the other hand , I believe that the profit incentive of private individuals which theoretically should improve their services could also lead to less than ideal consequences . Firstly , drug companies might find ways to cut costs in order to improve profits , which leads to lower quality products . Thus , money poured into research would not be used for making the best treatment , but more on how to make the cheapest one possible . Secondly , it might also be argued that since healthcare and pharmaceuticals are doing what is profitable instead of what is ethical , there might be an incentive to only research programs aimed at the former . For instance , instead of finding a way to cure diseases , drug companies might only try to find out how to alleviate the symptom", "Today , there is an ongoing discussion about whether the government should invest in art and statues supposedly to improve the quality of life in cities . In my opinion , investment in art and culture is essential to a functioning society . It has been said that a problem with funding art paintings and statues is that it takes away money from more essential infrastructure projects . It might be argued that issues like poverty and pollution are much more urgent , and affect the economy in a more profound way . For example , great wealth inequality as well as poor air quality could lead to greater crime and worsening mental health issues for those in the lower social strata . Hence , instead of focusing on art and culture , some may suggest that the money be used for creating more opportunities for disadvantaged people . On the other hand , I argue that an appreciation for art and culture , reflecting in things such as paintings and statues , is essential for a cohesive society . While bread and butter gives individuals a means to survival , art and culture could be said to provide people with meaning that extends beyond mere subsistence . Societies where people only work and are unaware of the history and culture reflected in cultural artefacts , I argue , would have no means of expressing a collective identity . Since humans can only see ourselves within a larger context , be it historically or culturally , investment in these areas are necessarily essential to well-being", "The interconnectedness of today\u2019s societies has led many to argue that issues should be solved through transnational cooperation , while others believe that the nation state should still be the primary unit of political action . In my opinion , as many urgent problems today affect the whole of mankind , such as climate change , there is a responsibility of all world leaders to work with one another . On the one hand , it could be said that national cooperation is more effective than international cooperation because citizens from one country are more likely to comply with the nation\u2019s legislation . This is especially the case for government policies that require the raising of taxes , since individuals are more likely to consent to such measures if they know that people with their same nationality can benefit instead of foreign people . For instance , there has been a great domestic political opposition to the German government\u2019s monetary support for Greece following the 2008 financial crisis , since many saw it as supporting a foreign society with no return . Thus , international cooperation has been shown in the past to lack political support . On the other hand , one could argue that due to the urgency and universality of today\u2019s problems , there must be international solutions . Over the last 50 years , it is clear that economies have become ever more interconnected , and the issue of one country can quickly become that of another . For example , the pollution created by many first world countries has been shown to result in climate change , creating swathes of economic refugees that in turn have to flee to first world countries . Therefore , it is crucial that a compromise be made by all national actors in order to prevent threats to both poor and rich countries", "Nowadays , it is common knowledge that university students are becoming busier than ever . Some people think that despite this , students should participate in other activities aside from only studying . I strongly agree with this statement . However , I do understand why university students should spend time studying . Firstly , working part-time jobs or participating in extracurricular activities can distract them from their studies . These activities sound more attractive than studying because there are rewards for them , such as money , connections , or friends . As a result , there have been cases where students eventually fail classes because of these activities . Another reason is that universities often promote team orientation by encouraging collective efforts . If students allocate too much time to peripheral activities , they would barely have time to squeeze a group meeting into their schedule , resulting in project failure . Despite these challenges , I still think university students should engage in other activities rather than just studying . As university students , they are becoming young professionals , so working either part-time jobs or internships means preparation for the workplace . Working also provides them financial independence from their family , which lessens their burden . Moreover , by participating in extracurricular activities , students can have a better understanding of what is going on in society . For example , many universities have debate clubs that discuss both international and domestic socio-political issues . Students can gain crucial insights into society through these", "A common question asked by students today is whether to travel or work in the year after completing their degrees . In my opinion , students should explore both themselves and the work after they graduate in order to ensure both the enjoyment of their careers and their mental wellbeing . On the one hand , there are those who believe that students should start earning money as quickly as possible in order to get ahead in the job market . Employers today prefer work experience due to the increasingly competitive job market , and as such , working straight after college could be attractive on one\u2019s CV . Therefore , their future potential earnings can be much higher if they start their career early . Furthermore , working early allows students to gain financial independence , which can improve their wellbeing further down the line . Yet I argue that while money and having an illustrious career is desirable , it should nonetheless not come at the cost of individual health . Many people today , I argue , start working too early purely for the money and without consideration as to what they truly want in life . As a result , young workers tend to burn out quite early before switching jobs to something more enjoyable . For instance , many junior investment bankers and lawyers quit after only two years , citing mental health and stress reasons . Therefore , a year of travelling might not only prevent this sort of work overload , but also provide people with clarity as to what they want to do", "Due to the rapid development of technology today , many people think that children no longer need to go to school to study . Instead , they can learn from the Internet and be home-schooled . I strongly disagree with this statement , however . It is common knowledge that children are not the most self-discipline demographic and that studying is not the most relaxing activity . This means that there have to be some forms of supervision to ensure children are studying instead of slacking off . Many parents think they can fulfill this responsibility , but in reality , having one parent stay at home to take care of their child\u2019s education does more harm than good . Firstly , this will put more financial pressure on the working parent to make ends meet for the family . Secondly , the pedagogical style of the teaching parent might not be suitable for the children , making home-schooling ineffective . Another reason why I think kids should not learn from the Internet or be home-schooled is the detrimental effects on their communication skills . For most children , school is not only a source of education but also a place where they can meet other kids , teachers , and other staff members . Some of the most beautiful and long-lasting friendships and romantic relationships stem from middle or high school , for example . Moreover , by meeting other children , parents can acknowledge some standards to which they should compare their children; hence , knowing if their children\u2019s development is on par with others . In conclusion , although the benefits technology brings to education are undeniable , I strongly disagree that children do not need to go to school because of this", "With regards to protecting the environment , there are those who believe that governments and politicians should be responsible , for individuals can only achieve so much . Personally , I believe that the government should indeed take up this mantle as it is their sworn duty to make decisions in the best interests of the populace and the country as a whole . Firstly , environmental protections are in everyone\u2019s best economic interests long term , and a government that aims to represent the will of the people should step in to make sure these are enforced . A healthy environment not only decreases the chances of the population succumbing to health related issues , it can also attract more tourists as well . Countries such as Singapore , for example , attract millions of people each year because of green spaces such as its Gardens by the Bay , showing that green investments might be both economically and socially helpful . Secondly , it is indeed true that individual action can only do so much in tackling environmental problems . It is incredibly difficult to mobilize individuals on a massive scale in order to have enough influence to incentivize high ranking political officials enough to inspire them to pass environmental protection laws . Instead , when government officials undertake ecological responsibilities , more gets done than could ever be accomplished by private individuals . For example , under Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency in the United States , many green spaces were put under government protection , saving many species of wildlife", "Today , there are many countries where rampant housing shortages are commonplace . In this essay , I argue that this results in a host of societal issues , and that the government should try and alleviate this problem . Firstly , I argue that housing shortages result in lower economic growth . People who do not have homes are more likely to suffer from the anxiety of having to pay monthly rent , while homeless people would also be unable to get jobs . This is because for the former group , owning a house as a way of retiring is out of the question , while for the latter , most companies do not hire people who do not have a house . Therefore , these people might turn to crime or other antisocial activities in order to survive . Thus , there are large sections of society that can be utilised , but are denied opportunities due to the housing crisis . Thus I argue that the government should step in and solve the problem . While people might hold that this should be done by the private sector , I contend conversely that this would simply lead to individuals buying up houses and driving up housing shortages again . Therefore , the government should use taxpayer\u2019s money to provide good and affordable housing . An example where this is already done is in Austria and Singapore , where citizens are virtually guaranteed a house by the government , with those who have money paying for private accomodation if they want", "The increasingly specialised nature of today\u2019s jobs could be said to have created many jobs that provide little satisfaction - while some argue that job satisfaction is not necessary , since people can find meaning in other things , there are those who contend that people not finding joy in their jobs will inevitably fall into nihilism . I agree with the latter opinion , and believe that finding a job one likes is essential to living a meaningful life . On the one hand , there are those who believe that for some , working jobs that they do not necessarily enjoy provides them the opportunity to provide for their children . A boring but high paying job may be able to provide for a child\u2019s education , housing and more , and the alternative of starvation would be much less meaningful . Thus , although they might not find meaning in their job , it might feel fulfilling enough for them that their life has meaning because they are living for a cause bigger than themselves . This is why many individuals , for instance , continue to do menial jobs that they nonetheless do not find meaningful , instead of simply quitting . On the other hand , I argue that since we spend most of our adult lives at work , it is imperative that we spend that time enjoying what we do . This is because an unenjoyable job can bleed into other areas of our lives - if we come from work frustrated , we are more prone to taking it out on our children or our partners . Moreover , a stressful and unsatisfying job might also affect one\u2019s health and diminish the ability to enjoy things . This means that in the end , we not only have little joy in working , but also other areas of life as well", "Although some might think that high school students should focus more on other subjects but literature , I strongly disagree that students should stop studying novels and poems . The first reason why students should continue learning about literature is that they can improve their communication skills . For example , students can expand their vocabulary , learn new ways of expressing themselves , and know how to put forth a logical argument . Many great writers have confirmed that the secret to better writing is via extensive pursuing . Learning about literature also helps with verbal communication , as students can pick up slang from a novel to use in real life . Also , there are many characters in famous Vietnamese works used to refer to certain qualities , such as using Hoan Thu to represent a jealous person . The second reason students should learn more about literature is that students can learn a lot about Vietnamese culture . Because literature reflects peoples' lives in a certain region during a certain period , much is revealed through studying novels and poems . For example , students can learn what lives were like from reading Chi Pheo , a famous short story . They can imagine what philosophy the villagers were practicing and what they did for a living . Moreover , students can interpret how much influence other cultures have on Vietnam through reading . An example of this is by examining the language used in literature to see where those words originate . In conclusion , there are multiple reasons why literature should be a big part of the curriculum", "There is a debate today about whether historical artefacts should be returned to the countries in which they originated . In my opinion , this should in fact be the case , as returning ancient items would reflect the atonement for the mistakes that the forefathers of a country has made . Some may argue that historical antiques should not be returned since it is unnecessary to do so , and transporting them may impose unnecessary risks on the objects . Ancient items may be so far removed from their contemporary civilization that returning it to the modern-day country might well be as foreign as staying in its current country . For instance , many items from Ancient Greece reflect a whole different society than Greece today , and so it is incomprehensible to return them to a people that is so far removed from the original society that they cannot claim ownership to it . On the other hand , it could be said that many historical objects today which belong in another country have been transported there as a result of conquest and imperialism . In the past , artefacts from other cultures were often stolen from natives from the third world in order to be displayed by the West - this makes it painful for descendants of plundered people today to not have items belonging to their forefathers . For example , most items in the British museum have been collected from its colonies through bloody struggle , and thus , it could be said that in a time of peace , returning the items to its place of origin is an act of making up for the past", "As there are increasingly more female leaders around the world , some people believe that this would lead to a more peaceful world , as opposed to the past violence allowed by male leaders . I disagree with this since the problem is not so much an issue between genders , but rather an issue of power; more specifically , power is what corrupts people . Many are quick to point out that in the past , the aggressiveness of many male leaders is what has led to war and conflicts . In order to display their masculinity , and To keep up an image of a patriarchal society , male leaders might act tough in order to gather the support of the populace . Female leaders , on the other hand , might display more sympathetic and diplomatic gestures and are less likely to resort to violence if disputes are to arise . In this way , they can garner public support by providing for their needs and wants in a more peaceful manner . On the other hand , if we look closely at history , we can see that this is not true . This suggests that it is not gender , but rather power , that drives aggressive behavior . Throughout history , for example , it has been shown that queens were statistically more likely to wage war than kings . A drive to secure resources is universal , and it could be argued that women might even be more observant in these sorts of situations to know when to wage war . As such , simply changing what sex a leader is will not lead to a safer world - rather , it is important to ensure that there are avenues of cross-country collaboration", "As the rate of obesity continues to climb in various countries , many governments have considered imposing a tax on junk food . Although I support this solution , I do not think it is effective unless combined with other measures . It is reasonable why a tax on unhealthy food is necessary . Firstly , this tax can encourage not just consumers , but also processed food industries and restaurants to change their habits . For example , since some US states imposed a sugar tax , many coffee and milk tea shops have offered a zero-sugar option at a discounted price . Secondly , I believe this junk food tax is sufficient to cover the additional costs to the health insurance fund . If more people eat junk food , they are likely to develop obese-related illnesses , a burden to national medical coverage . As a result , if people choose to eat unhealthily , they should pay extra to cover their future medical bills , which are partly subsidized by the government . However , this junk food tax alone does not guarantee significant changes in people\u2019s awareness . Firstly , without developing an alternative , there is still a lack of motivation to change their diet . For example , many people admit they would not mind a minimal increase in price if junk food is still cheaper than healthier alternatives . Secondly , and more importantly , this junk food tax serves as discrimination against the poor . Most fast-food consumers , at least in developed countries , are underprivileged people . Thus , taxing them would mean widening the gap between the rich and the poor . When the poor become even poorer , they are more likely to turn to junk food , as it is cheap and is a sufficient source of energy . As a result , this becomes an endless cycle", "According to some , reading stories from books is superior to watching TV or playing video games for children . I disagree with this sentiment , however , since there is not much evidence to the idea that books are inherently more beneficial to children , and that they should be given both mediums in order to aid their developmental processes . On one hand , child psychologists now believe that there may be far more benefits to playing video games which could be beneficial to their long-term development . Games are famous for improving spatial awareness and logic amongst younger children and can also serve to teach morality on a far better level than many books , for they purposely place the player in ethical scenarios with long-term consequences . For example , games such as Undertale are revered for their capabilities in teaching hard-hitting moral philosophy in a hands-on , a proactive approach that teaches the player the consequences of their actions . On the other hand , reading books is the only real way of improving literacy , which is essential for young children if they want to have a well-paying job in the future . Child literacy is often used as a measure to compare the educational performance of different countries , as a literate population can better absorb instructions needed to carry out their future professions . Therefore , improving a child's ability to read in the home through stories can be an effective way to improve their chances of financial success in the future . Overall I believe that while the traditional book is still hugely beneficial to children , TV , and video games have been shown to contribute to some aspects of their ability as well", "When looking back on human progressions , many people think that life in modern societies is generally better than that of in the past . Although I agree with this statement , I believe that it is also important to stress some challenges today\u2019s generation faces . It is undeniable that the quality of life these days has been improved tremendously by breakthroughs in medicine and education . For example , vaccines have helped prevent multiple painful and deadly diseases like mumps or measles . Efforts to mandate education have also been successful , resulting in an extremely high literacy rate in Vietnam . Secondly , other social aspects of modern life are better than ever . For example , women and homosexual\u2019s rights are protected by laws , and people are welcome to express themselves more in public . Moreover , many people nowadays can connect with friends and family members through the Internet , making long-distance relationships more robust . However , it is also worth noticing that modern society is littered with many problems the older one did not face . Firstly , it is evident that rising rates of mental health problems are the biggest issue right now . Because people are stressed out at work and school , their mental state is also fragile . As a result , suicide and divorce rates are comparably higher currently than in the past . Secondly , the current generation is facing adverse effects of pollution and climate change more rapidly . The notion of having clean air while living in urban areas is now something of the past , while plastic wastes continue to kill marine animals . Climate change is also more apparent as natural disasters keep getting worse each year , affecting millions of people . In conclusion , I must admit that life in current society is generally better than that in the past in terms of medical care , education , and other social aspects", "As the Internet is becoming more prevalent than ever , many people question the necessity of cultural and historical museums . I strongly oppose the idea that information that is now easily accessible on the Internet can replace museums . The first reason why museums are irreplaceable is that the experience of visiting a museum is unique . Most museums nowadays offer a wider variety of information than that on the Internet . For example , museums have more exhibits , simply because some do not have the right to be posted online . Moreover , many exhibitions , especially cultural ones , use a combination of audio , lighting , or even scents to introduce the subject . Also , museum collections are carefully curated , which is not a feature found online . Curators work tirelessly to acquire and sort exhibits to present culture or a historical period as objectively and scientifically accurate as possible . All of these factors are mostly not available online , which is why museums are necessary . The second reason why the Internet cannot replace museums is that its information is not sufficient . A major problem with information online is that , unless it is posted on an academic or government-affiliated website , it is largely unverifiable . As a result , readers cannot grasp the full picture of the topic presented . Another problem with only relying on information online is that researching online requires people to first think of the subject . Few people do that . On the other hand , visiting museums can teach people things they might not expect . For example , many US tourists reportedly said that they surprisingly felt a need to review their understanding of the Vietnam War after they visited the US War Museum in Ho Chi Minh City . Without going to that museum , they might never think about such a topic for the rest of their lives", "Recently issues have arisen regarding whether or not advertisements targeted at children should be legally allowed . Personally , I view advertisements aimed at children to be unethical , since not only are they still naive , but bombarding them with commercials can cause a rift in the relationship between them and their parents . Firstly , advertisements should not be aimed at children because they are highly suggestible , and as such cannot yet understand what is ultimately their best self-interests . Because they are incapable of making responsible fiscal decisions , marketing to this demographic means exploiting their inability to make rational choices for financial gain . For example , although children might want to buy lego sets advertised on TV , they often get bored of them as soon as they find out what they have bought is not like the advertisements . This exploitation of children\u2019s naivety could be judged to be unethical . Secondly , marketing to children inevitably leads to them pleading with their caretakers , who have disposable income to spend , which can lead to a deterioration in their relationship . Not buying children's toys could result in resentment in the relationship , for it is reasonable for caretakers whose duty it is to be fiscally responsible to refuse the child\u2019s requests . This situation if repeated enough may in turn lead to negligence and subsequently stunt child development . Psychological studies have shown , for example , that children who have been neglected perform worse in cognitive tasks then those who have not . In conclusion , I hold that not only are advertisements aimed at children unethical because it exploits their suggestibility , they can also affect children\u2019s relationships with their parents and damage them psychologically", "With the prevalence of the Internet today , many people think that it is virtually impossible to live in the current society without wi-fi access . I strongly agree with this statement . The first reason why I strongly support this belief is that the Internet is crucial for any job . Regardless of one's career or studies , one eventually has to utilize the Internet . For example , not just office workers and college students , but even heavy labor jobs , like drivers , use ride-hailing apps and navigation services daily , both products of the Internet . Another reason why the Internet is important to one\u2019s career and studies is that one uses it to apply for jobs and schools . For example , students nowadays find resources to practice for entrance exams online , while the unemployed use the Internet to find job postings and design their resumes . The second reason why I think the Internet is vital for one\u2019s survival is that it is now an indispensable means to keep up with society and loved ones . Because many people nowadays do not live close to their parents or , in some cases , with their best friends , they can use social media or free virtual calls to connect with their loved ones . Old means of long-distance communications are now replaced by faster alternatives that are products of the Internet . Social media also provides people with the news that traditional outlets , like TV broadcastings and newspapers , cannot . For example , the Vietnamese government even has its own Facebook page to communicate urgent notice . Also , social media offers a comment section that traditional media outlets do not . In conclusion , I strongly support the idea that an individual has to rely on the Internet to live in today\u2019s society", "\ufeffGovernment funding with regards to art , such as music and theater , have been a longstanding issue of debate - many people believe that their tax money should alternatively be spent on public services . Personally , I believe that both art and public services bring about different benefits to society , and so government investment in both is desirable . On the one hand , it is important to note that art is the voice of a society , and therefore , to fund art is to encourage the expression of society as well as the development and pursuit of new ideas . Art has always served as a window into the past and reconnects today\u2019s generation with previous ones , and has helped to create new creative movements . Such is why many European governments continue to fund museums and exhibits in their own countries despite many of them being unable to operate on a commercial basis , for they can showcase their own heritage and culture and inspire future generations . On the other hand , spending on public services helps to ensure a more immediate benefit to the population . As opposed to art , it could be said that public services are enjoyed by most if not all of a country\u2019s population , and therefore investing in it could be seen as much more equitable . Important public services such as healthcare also have the benefit of keeping the population healthy while creating numerous high quality jobs . The economic effects of public services could thus be observed to be more immediate and tangible than investments in art", "The choice between punishment and education as the most efficient method of mitigating the crime in society have been long grappled with . I personally believe in the necessity of a better education system over a harsh penal system for a more effective method of reducing crime . Firstly , imprisonment is not an ideal system of managing crime because it fundamentally fails at one crucial task i . e . instilling a code of morality , and therefore does not solve the problem of crime in the long term . What is necessary , ultimately , is to teach people what is right or wrong without the need for punishment; this way , less resources need to be spent on policing people , for individuals can police themselves . Focusing on a good education is how countries such as Sweden , despite relatively tame penalties for legal offences , have one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world . Secondly , there are large socio-economic factors that go into crime , and punishment does not help to alleviate them . It is no mistake that most criminals come from low income families with low social mobility , and due to a lack of economic opportunities , many people within this lower strata of society have no choice but to turn to crime . As such , harsh punishment might simply be counterproductive . In the United States , for example , harsh punishment has not led to a decrease in crime , but has resulted in a fifty percent recidivism rate , among the highest in the world . Therefore , I on the whole believe that the importance of instilling a sense of morality is much more effective than punishment at stopping crime", "With the widespread popularity of music nowadays , people think that the most important function of music is for the audience\u2019s relaxation . I strongly disagree with the statement , however , due to two main reasons . The first reason why I think music should be something more than a relaxation means is that music is a way for artists to express themselves . When writing music , composers often share their anecdotes , usually with comments on the side . Some of these stories can make the audience enraptured , some can make them feel miserable , or even some can make them skeptical about themselves . However , these are all the raw feelings that the artists want to share for the audience to sympathize with them , and I think this should be the chief function of music . Listening to music is like having a deep and personal conversation with its creator , just like any other forms of art . The second reason why I think music is not just for relaxation is that music is a way to deliver and spread awareness about political and social issues . This notion is especially ubiquitous in Western music , where artists have more freedom to express their views and beliefs with little censorship . It is a fact that political and social issues can spark strong feelings , and music is a way to deliver those feelings to the general public . This of course will put the listeners in an uncomfortable position because most Vietnamese still hesitate to talk openly about social issues . However , gradually , it will change this perception and encourage people to openly discuss social problems", "To tackle food shortages , many scientists recommend genetically modified (GM) food as a solution . Despite some concerns regarding this solution , I strongly believe that this is the future for food security . The first benefit that GM foods offer is that it has significantly higher yield compared to traditional crops . GM foods have their genes altered to reproduce their cells quicker , leading to faster crop productions . Also , GM foods are capable of withstanding harsh environments , such as during winters and dry summers . Another benefit of consuming more GM foods is that they require fewer pesticides , contrary to popular belief . Because scientists design GM foods to be resistant to common pests , farmers do not need to spray pesticides as regularly as they would growing traditional crops . However , despite these benefits , there are some concerns that researchers should revisit before populating GM foods . The first concern is the impact GM crops have on the ecosystem . Because these crops are known to be resistant to pests , it could lead to the eradication of pest species . As a result , this can disrupt the ecosystem\u2019s balance . The second concern is that , due to GM crops\u2019 high efficiency and rapid growth , they can easily become an invasive species with unhealthy farming practices . This problem , aside from damaging the ecosystem , also has adverse effects on the economy . For example , if one plot destined to grow a certain plant gets invaded by another species , farmers will experience a loss of income", "Despite the overall increase in digital news , many people believe that society will still get most of its information from newspapers . I personally contend that newspapers are struggling to find traction in the modern world due to their cost and inflexibility , and as time goes on , they will flounder and be replaced . Firstly , newspaper subscriptions of all kinds are decreasing since they are more expensive than the free online news . There is little benefit to getting newspapers delivered to the front door today , as with a touch of a smartphone , information from all over the world can be readily available at one\u2019s fingertips . Thus , digital news is both more affordable and more convenient to the masses , and companies who refuse to make the transition to online platforms suffer dramatically from lower financial returns . This is , for instance , why we see many traditional news sources going bankrupt and being replaced by online social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook . Secondly , digital news allows for more varied content to be offered than print media . More specifically , the former can incorporate video recordings , digital audio and high quality images , something that is simply not possible on newspapers . To read the news in newspapers is to miss out on the range of what can be communicated by news apps nowadays , which are able to provide a much more illustrative depiction of the real world . This is why traditional newspapers such as the Guardian or the Washington Post have moved many of their operations online: to make their content more diverse and thus to attract more readers . Overall , I argue that the benefits of digital news , both in cost and variety , compared to newspapers are significant", "The question of whether or not states should be self-sufficient in food production has long been the centre of intense debate , with some believing that countries should produce all foodstuff themselves . Personally , I do not believe states could and should be self-sufficient , since although this can have some positive economic effect e . g . a positive trade balance , it can also bring with it the instability of famines . Firstly , a country producing its own food has the benefit of reducing the amount it spends on imports , which has a positive effect economically in the long term . This is a huge consideration in nation-states that are still importing more than they are exporting , for money is technically flowing out of the country . This is why countries such as the USA , despite being the most powerful country in the world economically , still rely on a strong agricultural industry in order to keep their trade balance . On the other hand , food self-production can often lead to famines , for weather conditions can make or break a harvest . In the past , when countries grew their own crops and international trade was far lower , famines were much more frequent as there was more risk involved: a season of bad weather would mean a famine that could last year-round . Importing food from a variety of countries would minimize the risk incurred by fluctuating weather patterns , since risks to crops are more geographically spread out", "There could be said to be an increasing number of individuals who are becoming obese . Recent policy decisions have proposed that a price hike on fattening foods be implemented in order to dissuade people from consuming them and thereby curbing the obesity epidemic . I personally think that while this measure might help , it would not be nearly as effective as other measures such as portion control . Whilst there is no doubt in my mind that making fattening sugary foods more expensive would certainly curb the rise in obesity , it is still uncertain that it would necessarily be as effective as we might expect due to the price inelasticity of fast food products . Some might state the law of supply and demand as a reason why we might expect sugary food consumption to decrease when prices rise , but behavioral economics might propose that people would be more than eager to hand over more money for the fattening foods that they enjoy . This is why other addictive substances such as cigarettes , for example , have also been shown to be somewhat immune to price increases . Furthermore , a larger issue may actually be portion control , as having larger portions in each meal could actually encourage people to eat more . Particularly in fast food chains , food portions are exorbitantly large leading to each meal being calorically higher than normal meals . If portions are decreased for every meal , even if the price is lowered , it could lead to people consuming less calories per meal and thus becoming less obese . Studies have shown that by making bowls smaller , for example , individuals also consume less food . If governments apply this method to fast food restaurants , it could potentially decrease obesity rates more effectively than price hikes could", "Many people think that to study how people lived in the past , we should review filmed records rather than written documents . I neither agree nor disagree with this statement . I can understand why people strongly agree with the idea . Films and video records offer the watchers a more vivid and believable experience . Because film and video records let the audience get an understanding of past lives through their judgment , it is more impressive . Also , film and video records can hardly exaggerate past events , so the audience will have a more legitimate understanding . Another reason why many people agree is the personal aspect of learning through past videos . For example , if written documents are mainly by scholars , which tend to be objective , films are often based on anecdotes . This aspect makes the audience find the content portrayed more relatable to them when there is a story . However , I also understand that many people would opt for written documents when learning about the past . Written documents are more easily accessible and are faster to go through than film records . For example , historical or biographical books about past events are available in every bookstore and public library , whereas filmed records sometimes are not accessible for people from other countries . Written documents are also suitable for people who want to get only a brief review of past events because they can flip through the pages quickly . Another reason is that written documents are usually peer-reviewed . Video records stand to be biased because they mostly are for personal uses at that time , while written documents offer an overall perspective verified by historians . In conclusion , I neither agree nor disagree that there is a superior way to learn about life in the past", "As technological devices are getting more inseparable from modern life , many people argue that they are doing more harm than good . I strongly disagree with this statement , believing that smartphones and tablets offer undeniable benefits if used in moderation . The first reason why I disagree with the statement is the educational opportunities offered by these devices . Smartphones can help educate people from all age ranges , from kids to middle-aged adults , and backgrounds . Scientific and psychology Youtube channels , such as Vsauce or Veritaserum , provide information on various topics , often supported by experts from prestigious universities . Language apps , such as Duolingo , Memrise , or Google Translate , aid tremendously in mastering a language . The Amazon Kindle tablet has now become the new means to read books without having to physically own one or borrowing from a library . The second reason why I think technological devices are extremely beneficial is that they have become tools for people to make their living . Transportation services , like ride-hailing apps or delivery services , have now relied heavily on smartphones\u2019 apps , like Grab or Baemin . Many freelancers also use tablets to design logos , posters , or even decorative stickers to make a living . Reporters now utilize the recording feature offered on all smartphones to aid in their interviews . Individuals can also invest money in not just stock but also in smartphone apps , like Finhay . Influencers are also making a living from filming short videos on smartphones , then use them to upload to social media . In conclusion , I think the development of technological devices like smartphones and tablets is essential for modern life as they provide educational benefits . Moreover , they are tools for individuals nowadays to make money", "The issue of deciding what should go on academic curricula has been hotly debated , with some arguing that time would be better spent preparing for the exams with no time wasted on other skills such as cooking or dressing . Personally , I believe that the purpose of education is to develop children\u2019s potential , and this would mean teaching them not only academic subjects but also life skills . Firstly , the idea that schooling exists only to get young minds through a series of standardized exams can result in a generation of students that know nothing more than studying and who are unable to develop their potential . Education is meant to be a tool to empower and uplift children , to prepare them for the world and to ensure they thrive within it; to twist it into a mere scheme for achieving high scores on exams is to miss the point entirely , and could result in them not being able to discover hidden talents . Children who are taught to cook at an early age , for example , might find that it is their specialty - as they grow up , they might rather be a chef than an average worker . Secondly , whilst some will argue that this job should be delegated to the parents , relying on them to teach essential life skills is a flawed idea as they are not likely to have both the experience and the opportunity to teach such skills . Most low income families hold down two or three jobs at once , and are unable to make the time to teach such skills; students should therefore be taught basic housework skills in order to take care of themselves and support their parents . By saving time cooking , for instance , mothers can instead focus on answering emails , allowing them to supplement family income and better support their child in other ways", "Many people today contend that reading would be better than watching TV in developing one\u2019s imagination and language skills . I personally do not believe that any one format is inherently better at improving these creative capabilities , for it ultimately depends on the type of content and the mental age of the viewer that consumes the media . I argue that TV , through its ability to illustrate realistic or colourful depictions of life through an entertaining manner , can be beneficial for children in improving their mental capabilities . Those who are of early age might not be able to read , and as such , might pick up their spoken vocabulary from TV instead . Children\u2019s shows on channels such as Nickelodeon are hugely popular for this reason , as parents allow their kids to tune in to not only be entertained but to improve their skills at the same time . Nonetheless , it is true that some forms of creative and linguistic expression are conveyed better in writings than on TV . These are things such as character backgrounds or subtle details that can be obsessively explored in books . It would be more difficult for audio-visual mediums such as films to convey the same features in similar lengths . This is why many people often complain that movie adaptations often do not live up to the standards of the book , for the latter is able to delve into the nitty-gritty of the storyline better than a movie more often than not . Books could therefore be better for imagination and development past a certain age", "In recent years , there has been talk of prioritising science over other subjects for the sake of national progress . Although science is important , I argue that humanities subjects should also be included in the curriculum . Science could be said to have been a revolutionising force in improving the material conditions of humanity and thus can be argued to rightfully be prioritised within any learning program . Scientific breakthroughs allow production processes to become more efficient , improving both the quality and quantities of goods . These goods can either be exported to the international market , improving a country\u2019s prosperity , or used by the domestic population to improve their lives . It was through improving its scientific research that the United States , for example , is at the forefront of technology and leads in economic and military prowess . However , one might also argue that arts and humanities should be taught as well , for they create the leaders that can effectively guide science to its most socially beneficial conclusions . Science could be said to be a tool , and like other tools , require a direction that it can be used towards . More specifically , there are many ethical problems with using scientific technology such as gene editing that requires those who can consider the potential social consequences . Without arts and humanities , science might not serve the benefit of mankind , and might lead us towards a very dark path . Therefore , I believe that although science is important , it cannot be left on its own", "As metropolitan areas are becoming more overpopulated and tree density is dropping , many people think we should focus on planting more trees rather than building housing . I strongly support this idea . There are many direct advantages as to why people should plant more trees in urban areas . Firstly , many scientists proved that trees improve a lot of environmental metrics within a short time . For example , planting more trees results in cleaner air , lower average temperature , and a reduced carbon footprint . Secondly , allocating more space to trees can improve the aesthetic look of cities . For example , cities can build more botanical gardens that host various flowers and other beautiful plants . From an architectural aspect , this can add more contrast between the sharp look of buildings and the softer look of plants and flowers . Moreover , there are indirect benefits when there are more open spaces dedicated to trees . The first one is that to implement this policy , the government might need to demolish many old residential areas to have areas for parks . This decision is beneficial in many ways . For example , new apartment buildings can accommodate more people and ensure a higher quality of life . The second one is that with more parks , citizens can witness an improvement in both their physical and mental health . Children can hang out and exercise in these parks and botanical gardens , thus improving their physical health . Senior citizens and even working people can take afternoon or night walk to relax , thus improving their mental health", "The debate centres around whether or not preventative measures are more effective than incarceration is one that is central to our society , and to our policy decisions regarding criminals . In this essay , I will explain why I personally believe we should focus our efforts on education and training rather than incarceration . Firstly , there is simply no evidence that incarceration effectively reduces the chance that criminals will engage in crime after release - in fact , there is plenty of evidence against this idea . After serving their time in jail , ex-convicts often face large difficulties reentering the workforce as a result of punitive entry barriers , with the end result being a certain relapse as they have no other choice but crime . Countries with harsh punishment such as the US , for example , do much worse than countries such as Norway in terms of the recidivism rate; one could argue that the latter has been able to excel because of its educational approach to prisoners . Secondly , education and training programs in prisons have been shown to dramatically increase the chances of inmates becoming a productive member of society after their release , as employers are more likely to hire them . A lot of the inmates suffer as a result of being from low-income , poor education backgrounds , with no viable skill set needed for the job market . Job training and further education programs , thus , have been proven to provide inmates with jobs and prevent them from relapsing into crime in countries such as Switzerland", "When thinking about solutions to homelessness , many turn to providing houses for those who are too poor to afford one . I agree that this is a good solution , but the government should consider other problems arising as well . Providing homes for the homeless has many benefits to both those poor individuals and society . One of which is a reduction of crimes and an increase in social stability . Poor people usually resort to committing crimes , such as thefts , robberies , sexual assault , or minor social indecencies like being fake beggars or flashing oneself . Providing housing will help them stay more stable and find themselves a job , which lessens actions like the aforementioned . Moreover , homeless people are also vulnerable to harsh weather conditions . For example , recently , among hundreds of deaths in Canada due to heatwaves , the majority of them are homeless people . However , because charity is often a double-edged sword , the government should consider the following potential problems before investing in homes for the poor . Firstly , this solution does not guarantee to be successful in helping the homeless . Many have become accustomed to the begging life for so long that they are now incapable of feeling inclined to work , especially when they know they can beg for money and food . For example , many still act like they are disabled to ask for charity when they can work . Another problem is that this investment in charity housing will take a toll on taxpayers . Building houses is expensive and takes a great deal of time to finish , which means the government will delay other social development , like providing better healthcare , improving infrastructure , or investing in education . In conclusion , I agree that providing housing for people who cannot afford one due to poverty is a good solution", "Nowadays , with the internationalism trend , more people are living in foreign countries than ever . Some people think that learning the country\u2019s language and culture is essential for living there . To a moderate extent , I agree with this statement . However , I can understand why many people refuse to learn about the language and culture of the country they are living in . Firstly , many languages are notoriously difficult to learn , such as Mandarin , Vietnamese , or Thai . To be only moderately fluent in these languages means investing hours into learning . Many activities , like studying and working abroad , will be limited if these expectations are there . Another reason is that , in many countries , locals are fluent in more than one language . For example , most Taiwanese and Malays speak English fluently . Many cultures , like Thai , are also heavily influenced by other foreign cultures . As a result , foreigners from English-speaking countries have little trouble renting houses , buying groceries , or befriending locals even if they do not speak the language . On the other hand , there are many reasons why I agree with the statement . Firstly , even though some countries have citizens fluent in popular languages like English or Spanish , most of them are young people living in urban areas . This means that if people want to travel to more secluded places or work for local companies , they should expect a language requirement . For example , if a fresh graduate wants to work in a South Korean company , one must speak Korean fluently even if the company communicates in both Korean and English . More importantly , learning the local language and culture will create a sense of belonging for foreigners . When foreigners speak the language that locals speak and understand more about the locals\u2019 culture , they will understand more about how locals act and their beliefs . This will create personal connections between foreigners and the country they live in , which make their stay more relaxing . In conclusion , I understand that not everyone can learn the language and culture of where they live due to time constraints", "With the growing unemployment rate , many countries think children should stop receiving education after primary school to join the workforce after training necessary skills . I strongly disagree with this idea due to various reasons . The most significant reason why I do not support the idea is that I completely fail to see its effectiveness . If this idea were to be implemented immediately , society within a few years should expect an increase in the number of teenagers claiming that they are suitable to work . In this hypothetical situation , the older generations are still struggling to find jobs due to global unemployment . As a result , the competition for jobs will even be harsher for both generations . This solution is not effective as this would only generate more labor without job listings to accommodate them . Another reason why I think this idea is ill-advised is I believe that education beyond primary schools is essential . Primary schools only teach students basic math and little language skills . Moreover , the majority of students this age have low self-discipline . This means that to prepare them for the workforce , they will need extensive education to acquire both in-depth knowledge and soft skills . The current education system solves this problem by providing students with academic knowledge and various opportunities to practice these skills . Communication skills and self-discipline are also trained through group assignments and the pressure to perform well . All in all , this new solution does not do anything that the current system cannot . In conclusion , I do not support the idea because it is both ineffective and unoriginal", "With the advancements of technology , online classes are becoming more prevalent than ever . Many people believe this is why they will soon replace lecture halls . However , I strongly disagree with this statement because each method has its target audience and cannot be eradicated . I believe lecture halls are the most effective way to educate a large group of students due to various reasons . Firstly , this teaching method saves resources for both educational institutions and students . For example , most online classroom platforms , like Zoom , will charge institutions for student accounts , whereas lecture halls are university properties , and their maintenance costs , when divided among students , are cheaper . Secondly , lecture halls are better for classes that require direct communication between students and professors . For example , discussion-based courses , like writing or philosophy , have proved to go better in lecture halls because students can build personal relationships among fellow students and the lecturer . Classes involving doing experiments would also benefit from this teaching format . However , that is not to say that online classes do not offer any benefits at all . One of their main advantages is that they are suitable for people with strict schedules , like working students . Attending online non-synchronous classes can benefit them because it is significantly easier to work or travel and still catch up with course materials . Another advantage is that online lectures are usually better than face-to-face ones at helping students to review the materials . Students can re-watch lecture videos and read slides to prepare for exams . On the contrary , when attending lecture halls , students have to diligently take notes , since few lecturers allow recording in classes . Moreover , when reviewing online lectures , students can speed up these videos to save time on content that they feel confident in . In conclusion , I believe that both face-to-face lectures and online classes have their advantages to offer both students and lecturers", "Because stress is so prevalent these days , many people have reached out to psychologists for their advice , only to hear that it is best to do nothing to relieve stress . I strongly oppose this opinion because I think it worsens the situation . Firstly , doing nothing at all will aggravate the stress from both physical and mental standpoints . Being idle will make you think more about your stressors because your mind will eventually wander to what you worry the most about at the moment . For example , many people reported failing to calm themselves down during stressful times because they keep thinking about work , school , or relationships , which are common stressors . Another point is that studies have shown exercises produce adrenaline and dopamine , which are chemicals responsible for being focused and happy . This finding means that being active is much better for your mental health than sitting around doing nothing . Secondly , I think the most effective way to not get stressed out is to resolve your stressors rather than doing nothing . Not taking any actions means avoiding your problems , which means that even if you manage to successfully stay calm at this moment , you eventually will have to face your stressors at another time . Moreover , when people take actions associated with their source of stress , like reviewing their resumes , doing more practice tests , or seeing a therapist , they will feel better regardless of the results due to a sense of accomplishment . Another action to be taken is talking to friends . Many people share their worries to seek empathy or approval , thus relieving stress . In conclusion , I strongly disagree with the idea that you should do nothing and wait for the stress to go away", "As the younger generations struggle to apply for jobs , they begin to wonder if holding interviews is the best way to assess candidates . I moderately agree that in some cases , interviews are not the best method . There are many reasons why people are skeptical about using interviews to examine candidates\u2019 qualities . Firstly , an interview does not fully reflect candidates\u2019 abilities , especially for candidates applying to technical positions in the IT and engineering industries . For these positions , the best way to assess their abilities is through tests , such as programming tests , case studies , or teamwork sessions with other candidates . Secondly , it is hard to evaluate candidates through interviews because they can lie . Many people admitted to having lied at least once , especially when asked about their past experiences or projects . For example , many told recruiters that they significantly contributed to projects that they hardly participated in . However , I still think that recruiters should combine interviews with other evaluations because they are still efficient . The first advantage is that the interview gives both employers and applicants a chance to see if applicants are suitable for the company\u2019s culture . For example , employers can observe candidates\u2019 manners , dress codes , or attitudes , whereas candidates can see how other workers are treated . Another advantage of interviews is that they are quick and easy to conduct . Most employers will spend only 30 minutes interviewing candidates before usually giving a tour around the workplace . This is also the most direct way to communicate with applicants because both parties can discuss sensitive topics that otherwise would be inappropriate to touch on , such as salary , benefits , or workplace culture . In conclusion , I agree that for technology companies , using only interviews as an assessment during their hiring process is not sufficient", "There can be little doubt that in recent decades a lot of time and money has been spent on protecting wild animals . Although spending on protecting these kinds of wild animals can sometimes be beneficial to humans , I would argue that it is of higher importance to allocate these resources to the human population . On the one hand , it is reasonable to provide financial support for wildlife protections . In fact , by saving wild animals , humans are saving themselves . Wild animals , for instance , may hold the keys to certain medical breakthroughs , just as many modern medicines are based on compounds found in plants . Moreover , humans , animals and other forms of life all form a giant ecosystem whereby each part can influence the others . If a certain animal becomes less common , this , in turn , will reduce the population of the animals that prey on it , which is more likely to disrupt the ecological balance and eventually threatens the survival of human society . However , it is sometimes difficult for people to accept that these perfectly legitimate reasons outweigh the immediate requirements of the human population . If money is not available to people who have problems such as mental illness , physical disabilities or to those living in dire poverty , it is inevitable that some will suggest spending less on wild animals . There is a strong argument that by spending more on the education of humans , we could make the world a better place for us and for wild animals . Overall , I tend to agree with those who claim that too much money is currently being spent on wild animals at the cost of humans . This is not to suggest that we cut all funding for wildlife projects since many of these projects can directly benefit humans", "It is now not uncommon to see negative news hit the headlines and appear frequently in the mass media . For this reason , many people believe that media positivity should be encouraged and I do agree with this idea for two main reasons . First , audiences are increasingly bombarded with negative stories and therefore , good news should be reported more often to balance out . In fact , journalism\u2019s commitment to being society\u2019s watchdog is understandable , but excessive negativity in the news can be harmful . For instance , after a tragic plane crash in Malaysia was broadcast , news agencies the world over started to report similar accidents during the next months . This created collective fear for air travel , which consequently hurt the aviation industry despite the fact that air transport is still the safest option , with incident rates far lower than those for road and rail transport . In this way , an excessive amount of bad news causes distorted views and this is why the more good news is worth reporting . Secondly , happiness is highly contagious , hence the need for positive media coverage . Good news can inspire readers or viewers to take action , which can benefit themselves and even society as a whole . The success of Flappy Bird , a mobile game created by Dong Nguyen that caused a global sensation in 2013 , has been an encouraging story . Thousands of Vietnamese app developers have subsequently tried to start their own businesses in order to follow in Dong Nguyen\u2019s footsteps . Although very few of them can achieve similar success , entrepreneurship is promoted , which comes as good news for both developers themselves and the country\u2019s economy", "It is widely believed that a building\u2019s function should be considered more important than its exterior in the design stage . Although an attractive appearance is beneficial sometimes , I would argue that the true function of a building should have higher priority . On the one hand , there is no doubt that a magnificent outer space can bring about the immense commercial value . For example , with shopping centers or apartments for rent , it is the outward appearance that attracts the customers\u2019 attention . A person who gets a positive first impression of the exterior is more likely to enter the building to ask for services . Therefore , the outlook of the constructions is always regarded as an effective advertising tool that brings considerable revenues for their owners . In addition , some buildings symbolizing the history of the city they are located in also need to be beautiful from the outside . Take the Hanoi Opera House as an example , it has long been considered a Vietnamese cultural site , so maintaining its attractive exterior is undoubtedly an essential task . On the other hand , the function is also of significance to a building . The first reason is that every construction needs to be safe and comfortable . For instance , a shopping mall has to possess a wide walkway , a good lighting system , and adequate emergency exits . Furthermore , each building has its own practical use , so architects have to design it with a view to satisfying the requirements of the building\u2019s users . A theatre , for example , is supposed to have a well-designed sound system and a scientifically-arranged hall so that everyone in the audience can conveniently enjoy movies or shows", "Museums and art galleries play an important role in offering multifaceted knowledge to the public . Some individuals opine that these institutions should primarily focus on their local history and art instead of global works of art . However , I disagree with this viewpoint as international works provide various benefits to the public . Museums and art galleries offer a medium for understanding cultural heritage . By focusing on local history and art only , such institutions limit the knowledge of the public to the domestic borders . Conversely , if art and history from other parts of the world are displayed , museums and art galleries exhibit multiculturalism , allowing people to understand distinct histories and cultures , and thus , enhancing globalization . For example , the Vatican museum exhibits works from several European countries , allowing the smallest country in the world to be a bridge to explaining cultural values of distinct nations under one roof . Moreover , international historical and cultural works would allow individuals to gain information on critical international issues that many countries face together . Many museums choose to have educational international exhibitions of important political and social issues , which may be more informative than the media . For instance , the War Remnants Museum in Vietnam has collections from across the country and globe in order to depict thoughts on poverty , war , and trade , and in a survey , 88% of visitors declared that they felt more informed about such issues from the museum than from the news", "Some people opine that people can do away with traditional libraries because technology has given us the facility of virtual or online libraries . Although technology has reduced our need to go to the libraries , traditional libraries can never become redundant and maintaining them is not a waste of money . On the one hand , it can be a waste of money to keep libraries open . The advent of new technologies like computers and the Internet has transformed traditional libraries from venues containing a large number of printed documents into paperless libraries containing only digitized documents . This has led to the creation of virtual libraries in which the user has access to information at any time and anywhere in the world by using the modern tools of communications , such as computers and Internet facilities . Therefore , it is unnecessary to spend money on traditional libraries because fewer and fewer users use them . However , libraries still play an important role these days . Firstly , a person goes to a library not only to search and get information from books but also to sit and study there . The peaceful and scholarly ambiance of the library helps one to concentrate more on one's work and study . Secondly , virtual libraries can be accessed only by those who are computer literate . For elderly or disadvantaged individuals who rarely have a chance to be exposed to cutting-edge technologies like computers or smartphones , it is much more challenging to access information online than going to a traditional library", "It is argued that teaching children the literature of their own country should be given more importance than that of other countries . While children will gain a range of benefits when studying literature works from their own culture , I also believe that learning foreign literature is equally important . On the one hand , children can derive several benefits from learning the literature of their country . In fact , a literary work always reflects the historical context when it is written and characters in the works show ways of life of people in that context . Such knowledge that children gain from literature lessons helps to extend students\u2019 knowledge of their own country\u2019s history and culture . In addition , literary works such as folktales , poems or stories help develop children\u2019s patriotism . For example , children who have been told about the Thanh Giong story have the chance to learn about how their ancestors went through various challenges and even sacrificed themselves for the independence of Vietnam; therefore , they are reminded to make every possible effort in everything they do in order to contribute to the development of their country . On the other hand , I believe that teaching children literature of other nations is equally important . Foreign literature books provide kids with in-depth knowledge about the cultural and traditional values of different parts of the world . This can help them to avoid cultural shock or other culture-related problems when they travel abroad or work for an international company in the future . Another reason is that by learning literature from both local and foreign resources , children would be able to think from different perspectives when encountering a problem . This helps develop better decision-making and problem-solving skills", "Careless driving and violation of traffic rules certainly result in a large number of accidents . Although it is argued that the only solution to reduce them is to strictly punish reckless drivers , I believe that there are other measures that are equally effective in ensuring road safety . In the first place , there are certain accidents that occur not because of traffic violations . To explain it further , poor road conditions are considered a major reason for road casualties . For example , narrow roads and sharp curves often force even law-abiding drivers to make mistakes . Therefore , it should be noted that drivers alone cannot be blamed for such mishaps , and giving them stricter punishments in these cases is no solution . A more effective strategy by the government would be to straighten accident prone-curves and widen narrow roads . A larger number of road signs and proper traffic signals can also be effective in reducing accidents on roads . Furthermore , poor climate conditions can be a major cause of accidents . For instance , poor visibility due to dense mist and rain , slippery roads on account of snowfall making driving difficult and causing serious accidents in many countries . Stricter punishment for drivers is a futile exercise in handling such problems . Modern technological innovations on cars' wheels or on-road design should be used to deal with such emergency situations . On the other hand , reckless driving , speeding , and breach of traffic rules by careless drivers have caused many accidents . Moreover , drunken and drowsy driving has also resulted in serious traffic mishaps . While more stringent punishment for drivers would be an effective measure to an extent , it should not be considered the only way towards road safety", "It has been said that physical ability is the most crucial aspect in achieving success in sports , while others argue that other essential variables are involved . Both physical and intellectual ability , in my opinion , are equally significant to achieving success on the athletic field . Firstly , physical prowess is necessary for success in sports since most sporting activities entail some sort of physical ability . Even while various sports require varied levels of strength from the individual , the team with the most muscular bodies will often triumph . This is because sports were initially invented to highlight physical abilities like speed , strength , and stamina . In a football game , for instance , the team with players that are physically able to cover more ground faster has a better chance of winning . This also happens in most other sports , and it has been widely accepted that a well-trained physique can boost the likelihood of victory . On the other hand , although physical ability certainly helps increase one's chances of winning , many people also believe having a strong mind is essential . Even if all players are physically capable of defeating the other squad , the team might still be vulnerable when they lack the skill to use strategic moves effectively . In sports such as basketball , for instance , even when the opposing team is in greater physical condition , the team with superior plans and preparation not only overwhelms the opponent but ultimately causes them to lose the game . In instances like these , intellectual capacity is crucial in sports", "Many believe it is worthwhile to lavishly celebrate significant life events with friends and family , while others hold the opposite view . I agree with the second position since it recognizes that this practice might encourage materialism and prejudice . On the one hand , to flaunt their riches and elevate their social position , some individuals spend a disproportionate amount of money on lavish family celebrations . Proponents of this idea often point out that weddings and other family ceremonies are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities . For this reason , it becomes reasonable to allocate more budgets to ensure that important occasions leave lasting impressions on everyone involved . A family's socioeconomic position is sometimes judged by the care with which they plan their family celebrations . Their social standing will improve with the more significant expense of the gathering . This is especially pertinent and advantageous when family members work in political or relationship-related sectors . On the other hand , there are several problems with throwing lavish family festivities . The first is that an unhealthy fixation on money may cause one to become obsessed with material things . This means surface characteristics are given greater weight in social judgments than core values . Second , this practice might encourage inequality . Peer pressure and ridicule may be especially harsh for young adults who lack the resources to invest in luxurious birthday parties . There is already evidence of this tendency in countries where money is idolized , such as China , where they shame one another over the cost of their birthday parties and weddings", "While some argue that history has nothing significant to teach us , others insist that understanding the past help us better grasp the present . Personally , the second viewpoint is more reasonable since we may be better prepared for the present and future by learning from previous mistakes . First , some individuals are skeptical of historical accounts because they believe they are biased . In most cases , physical and scientific evidence is insufficient to establish the knowledge . For this reason , many individuals dismiss historical trivia as legends or exaggerations that contribute nothing to modern life . In Vietnam , for instance , archaeologists have uncovered old remains in various locations , but they have yet to match this information with the proper knowledge provided in history books about the ancient kingdom . However , I cannot entirely agree with this idea since a lack of proof does not mean the past is not genuine and irrelevant . On the other hand , knowledge of history is vital for comprehending the present and future . In reality , by studying the past , not only can we learn from our mistakes and improve our future actions , but we may also be inspired to work harder by hearing about the heroic efforts and personal sacrifices that our ancestors made . In Germany , for instance , educating children about World War II history is a must because of the many lessons and insights it provides for helping them learn from and prevent repeating past errors", "To be successful in life , some individuals are of the opinion that wise arrangement skill is of utmost importance . However , others opine that various elements including hard work and luck also contribute to success . From my perspective , the combination of multiple factors can ensure great achievement for people . On the one hand , good planning offers individuals clear goals and suitable allocation of resources . Regarding the former advantage , wise planning can help people to identify exactly which direction they should follow in the future . Arrangement in advance provides us more opportunities to look forward and examine the benefits and drawbacks of each goal that we set , thereby reducing the risks involved and increasing the chances of success . In addition , thanks to good planning skills , individuals may reasonably allocate resources that they currently have . For example , if one desires to open a coffee shop , by planning the financial stages as well as economic knowledge and competency beforehand , he can decide on the scale of his business and predict future interest generated from the business . Therefore , there are high chances that he will be successful . On the other hand , despite the significance of good planning , other factors such as diligence and fortune also shares equal importance . To begin with , being hard-working is undoubtedly the first and foremost crucial factor in determining one\u2019s success . Despite the number of failures we have to face in life , there are still possibilities of success once we are consistent in accomplishing our goals . Not to mention that sometimes , luck plays a pivotal role in defining the success of people . Even though being fortunate cannot be scientifically explained , we all accept that luck does share almost the same level of importance in defining one\u2019s success", "Some individuals opine that celebrities performing pop music should be paid higher salary in comparison to those majoring in classical music , while others are not in consummate accord with the aforementioned idea . This essay would delve into discussing the two perspectives as well as stating my support for the former one . It is reasonable for classical music performers to earn more money due to their huge effort in mastering instruments and traditional values that they preserve . Chief among these is that those who pursue traditional music has spent a plethora of time and attempt to be adept at using instruments and the specific style of each category of classical music . Obviously , traditional music requires not only thorough understanding of its nature but also the talent as well as constant practice to deliver the best piece of music enjoyed by the public . Concerning the second viewpoint , classical music plays a paramount importance in preserving traditional values of a country . It is true that the more money artists performing classical music can earn , the more possible that they would not change jobs . As a result , there are chances that future generations can still enjoy one of some masterpieces in music field . Nevertheless , I strongly believe that more financial means should be paid for pop celebrities due to their short-term contribution and great attempt in maintaining positive images . With regard to the former , the majority of pop stars have to face the challenge of a short-lived career since the entertainment industry is constantly changing . Consequently , for around one or two decades of contribution , most of those well-known artists would be replaced by other more talent and dynamic ones . Another point is that performers of pop music always trying to set good examples especially when presenting in public . Since they aware of their significant impact on people , particularly teenagers , great effort in creating and maintaining favourable figure has been made by these individuals . Therefore , it is logical that stars performing pop music should earn more money", "Considerable impacts on the environment made by human activities have been a heated debate . Some individuals are of the opinion that tackling those environmental issues is impossible . However , another school of thought opines that changes can be made to reverse the current situation . Personally , I suppose that only if urgent actions are taken , those aforementioned problems will soon be solved . Those who advocate the lateness in improving environmental problems may point to the extinction of animals and the exceeding rate of global warming . Chief among these is that human activities , such as hunting and poaching , are the major culprit in the vanishment of a myriad of fauna and flora species . Accordingly , the ultimate adverse consequence is the imbalance in our ecosystem , which creates obstruction in the food chain . However , no feasible approach can be applied to rebirth those species . The second idea is that the substantial increase in industrial production combined with excessive deforestation has contributed to the alarming situation of global warming . And it is a bitter truth that efforts made to decrease the world average temperature once it rises will eventually become fruitless . Nevertheless , I still argue that fostering awareness among citizens and global cooperation will be effective measures in addressing the issue . Regarding the former , thanks to being fully aware of the detrimental impacts on the environment , a myriad of workshops or propaganda are organized to educate and encourage an environmentally-friendly living style . For example , using canvas bags instead of plastic ones in shopping has become a trend among youngsters nowadays . Another point worth mentioning is that various international law in protecting the environment has been established on the foundation of international agreement . For instance , governments have made attempt to eradicate destructive habits and save the lives of endangered species by raising funds to protect their natural habitats", "The debate over which group , namely the elderly and younger generations , should be of utmost appreciation is one that has been long contested . I am of the opinion that despite the economic values fostered by young adults , gratitude towards older people should be expressed due to general human morality and their thorough understanding . Those who suppose that valuing youth is pivotal may well say that the young population would be crucial in laying the foundation and making progress for the national economy . The young , who comprise the majority of the workforce in the world , are innovative , passionate , and diligent in working to create breakthroughs in myriad fields . They , therefore , play a key role in boosting economic growth and establishing a higher living standard . Thus , the young generation should be provided with favorable conditions to widen their horizons and be contributing members of society . Take Mark Zuckerberg , the 37-year-old CEO of Facebook , as a prime example - this creative young man has successfully created a global social network - a multi-billion dollar business model , which can revolutionarily facilitate communication across the globe . Notwithstanding the aforementioned arguments , I still believe that under no circumstances should older people be depreciated because of moral principles in human life and their wealth of knowledge . Regarding the former , seniors have devoted their whole life to contributing to the growth of our society; therefore , treating them with dignity and respect is of paramount importance . Coupled with this is that the elderly have ample life experience passed down from one generation to the next as valuable lessons which are essential in assisting young people to tackle obstacles and guiding them to the right path in life . This fact explains the rationale behind the reality that a great number of leaders in the world are seniors", "Whether scientific research should focus on alleviating global health issues or other problems has gained traction . Personally , I agree with the latter opinion for a number of reasons . On the one hand , finding a solution to world health problems is a pressing matter that should be pursued by the scientific world . As health issues can affect people\u2019s well-being immediately and on a wide scale should that be an infectious disease , scientists\u2019 efforts and attention can be valuable in saving many people\u2019s lives . Take the Covid-19 pandemic for example . Though it is relatively new , it has posed dire threats to people\u2019s physical and mental well-being and finances . Without the timely arrival of vaccines , it would have been as deadly as previous plagues in history , such as the Black Death or the Spanish Flu . On the other hand , advocates of devoting scientific research to alleviating other worldwide issues have grounds to believe that this can bring people more advantages . First , there are many other critical issues that can affect humans on a wider scale , such as global warming and pollution . Though people do not see their effects immediately , environmental problems harm humans slowly and its impacts are difficult to reverse . Furthermore , apart from health , other fundamentals for human\u2019s survival are water and food . Without scientific advancements to ensure food security , citizens in developing countries or areas hit with famine would not be able to survive", "While some people argue that technological advancements help reduce the number of criminal activities , others opine that it actually increases the crime rate . Personally , I side with the former as progress in technology has had a positive impact on the world's crime scene . On the one hand , developments in technology have paved the way for an emerging kind of crime: cyber-crime . As most transactions nowadays are done via the Internet , thieves can hack into one\u2019s account and tamper with online transactions , sending the money to his bank account instead of that of the actual recipient of the payment . A milder case would be information thievery , in which one\u2019s personal information would be stolen and sold to a third party , who , in a positive case , are advertising companies , or to catfishes , in the worst case scenario . For example , a number of frauds in Vietnam happened to middle-aged women , who were swindled out of millions by imposters acting as their children or relatives online . On the other hand , technological advancements have helped solve cases faster and prevent criminal activities . First , high-tech gears and programs can help detect offenders effectively and in a timely manner . To illustrate , a 35-year-old cold case in Texas has just been solved using DNA technology . The 1986 murder was thought to be hopeless as no visible evidences were found , yet innovations in crime science has brought new and concrete proofs . Another use of technological developments is to prevent crimes . What this means is that through the use of technology , crime attempts can be deterred . For example , released convicts will usually be forced to wear a GPS tracking device . Thanks to this , many criminals have abandoned their recidivism plan as they could be easily sent back to jail", "Whether citizens should be allowed to use fresh water freely or governments should put restrictions on the amount of fresh water citizens can have access to has gained traction . In my opinion , while each view has its merits , I agree that water usage should be regulated . On the one hand , being able to use fresh , clean water is a human's basic necessity . First , besides food , water is another fundamental contributing to human\u2019s well-being . Therefore , if people were not to get an adequate amount of water to sustain basic activities such as hydrating themselves , cooking , and cleaning , their human rights would have been violated . Secondly , people have varying needs for water so restricting the amount of water used to an average number would be disadvantageous to those whose businesses involve heavy water usage , for example , people involved in farming activities . On the other hand , introducing regulations on fresh water usage can have undeniable positive effects . Water is a scarce resource , so making it freely available can lead to depletion of fresh water and unequal distribution of water . As a matter of fact , water sources have been depleting in recent years due to global warming , droughts , and pollution . Consequently , if individuals are free to use water at their own discretion , it will lead to faster exhaustion of this rare resource . Another grave effect is that people in some countries who have difficult access to fresh water will have to receive less as people in other countries have used it extravagantly", "There have been increasing concerns about the circulation of movies with elements of violence . While some contend that the government should establish boundaries for violent content , others argue that these films have to be banned . In my opinion , violence in movies should only be limited , not prohibited . On the one hand , it is understandable why violent films should be banned , because it can leave a negative influence on people\u2019s psyche . Due to the internet and pirated movie websites , if not supervised carefully , children can gain access to age-inappropriate films . In the case of adults , the popularity of villain protagonists can lead to misunderstandings that the antisocial behaviors portrayed are encouraged . What is alarming is these young people are impressionable and therefore , can establish riotous behaviors after prolonged exposure . For example , in Japan , a 24-year-old man dressed up as \u201cThe Joker\u201d - a notorious fictional villain - and set a train on fire after stabbing fellow passengers . However , the majority of individuals can set a boundary between real life and fiction , thus , banning violent films is rather excessive . On the other hand , violent films are a form of entertainment for a part of audiences and therefore , should not be prohibited . These viewers find joy from the thrill and excitement offered by violent elements in movies , so forbidding their hobbies for the sake of a minority of audiences equals practicing injustice upon these individuals . Furthermore , without actions , movie makers will lack a key ingredient in building films\u2019 charms . Nowadays , 90% of movies are sprinkled with violence , as even the slightest form of physical conflicts can be considered violent . Consequently , filtering savage elements will be a tantalizing task and oftentimes impossible as it would dull the plotline . Therefore , the optimal solution would be to restrict the appearance of gratuitous and extreme violence in movies", "The trend of international cooperation has opened up a host of opportunities for developments . While some argue that these advantages are mostly in environmental protection , others claim that businesses will benefit most . From my perspective , both sides are correct , as international cooperation can simultaneously do good to the two mentioned sectors . On the one hand , joint efforts from all nations can have positive effects on the environment . First , as many environmental crimes are operated cross-border , governments must collaborate to detect and deplete these activities . By way of illustration , illegal logging in Southeast Asia spans across the lands of Brunei , Laos , Indonesia , et cetera . Each country accounts for a part in the illegal wood supply chain . Therefore , Southeast Asian nations should cooperate to destroy the illegal timber production line , as a country\u2019s lone effort would only result in the contemporary eradication of a mere portion of the chain . Secondly , international cooperation allows countries to learn from each other and create optimal solutions to similar problems . Nations with matching backgrounds can use each other\u2019s campaigns as case studies and apply accordingly to their respective countries , resulting in better effectiveness . On the other hand , the world economy will gain considerable advantages through multinational cooperation . Thanks to globalization , many businesses are having subsidiaries worldwide , creating numerous job opportunities for the locals . For example , various underdeveloped areas are receiving a boost in economic growth due to international companies constructing their off-shore headquarters there . Hai Phong in Vietnam , where Samsung built their subsidiary office , is an exemplary example as the province has welcomed an increasing number of laborers . Additionally , multinational conglomerates can enjoy attractive economic incentives from foreign nations , thus helping them save additional costs on tax and more . In Vietnam , Lego enjoyed feed-in tariffs , tax exemptions , and investment subsidies for building their first carbon neutral plant in the country", "Whether students should be allowed to criticize and give recommendations to their teachers has been a hotly debated topic . While some people argue that this means a loss of respect and order in a classroom , I support the view that this development could lead to a better educational experience . On the one hand , two-way feedback between teachers and learners could possibly result in a lack of regard and discipline . First and foremost , most students lack emotional maturity and thorough understanding of the world\u2019s workings to give constructive comments . In case a student is impulsive and immature , he could sabotage the teacher\u2019s reputation by giving unjust criticisms should he be hostile towards the teacher for giving him bad marks or reprimanding him . Moreover , as each student holds different opinions , it would be difficult for the teacher to come to a unified conclusion as to what he should improve on . This could lead to confusion and strenuity for educators who are trying to establish themselves as better teachers . On the other hand , I agree that empowering students with the ability to assess their educators could lead to the betterment of education . To start with , the core of education is to serve students and equip them with more knowledge , thus , understanding their insight and needs are critical to being a successful educator . Through learners\u2019 responses , teachers could refine their methods and make adjustments to their lesson plans to better suit their students , resulting in more educated and motivated learners . Furthermore , this development could help teachers to hone their pedagogical skills . As teachers are forced to alter their teaching methods , they will encounter more innovative approaches , and become more flexible in dealing with special cases in the classroom", "There have been opposing views concerning advertisements . While some people claim that it can be beneficial for businesses , others opine that advertising is detrimental to individuals . In my opinion , both ideas are correct to a certain extent . On the one hand , advertising has long been used by business owners as a great tool to boost sales . Advertisements can give new products recognition and help educate first-time buyers . This means that it can introduce innovative services that have never existed before to the public , or partly guide clueless consumers who have never purchased a product before on its range and qualities . A prime example of this is Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign . In the old days , Nike\u2019s products catered mostly to athletes , but in the late 1980s , Nike created this campaign to introduce its shoes to the masses . The effort was successful in helping Nike tap into a new demographic and in yielding never-before-seen profits for the brand . On the other hand , advertisements have undeniable negative effects on human\u2019s psyche . Advertising\u2019s core mission is to keep customers informed , however , this is a double-edged sword , as new yearnings are also created , preventing people from being satisfied with what they have and boosting consumerism culture . As individuals are bombarded with advertisements which state that they need something new to better their life , depreciation of their existing assets will appear . For well-off people , life will become a constant race to possess the next ground-breaking products , while for less fortunate ones , they will unconsciously suffer from feelings of inferiority due to not having what is considered good - as stated on advertisements . These are unhealthy modes of living that people should not have to experience . All in all , whether advertising is advantageous or not depends on the standpoint", "Whether employees should jump from one job to another or they should work at the same position throughout their career has been a controversial topic . In my opinion , while changing jobs can be beneficial to a certain extent , being in a similar position is more advantageous to both the individual and the employer . On the one hand , career changes can benefit employees in many ways . First , job hoppers can hone diverse skills and possess an expansive knowledge spanning across different fields . As each position requires unique abilities , when switching jobs , employees can master a new skill , which can be of importance to positions that entails cross-department communication and cooperation . Moreover , individuals who change jobs often will be less likely to become jobless , as their diverse skill set can be applied in any post . For instance , during the Covid-19 pandemic , people who had additional knowledge in a field different from their job can find new positions once personnel reduction took place . On the other hand , advocates of working constantly in one post have firm grounds to argue that this trend has numerous positive effects . Concerning individuals , being loyal to a position means that their incentives are high , including seniority bonuses as well as labor insurance . Whereas job hoppers can never expect this as their short-term work will always put their benefits at a new employee level . As for companies , having faithful employees can help them cut training costs and avoid problems that can arise from newcomers . When a new member joins the team , the company has to pay for their lack of efficiency and experience . This is not the case of longtime employees , whose incentives are only tools to motivate them to achieve greater success , not a retribution on the company for their senior employees\u2019 mistakes", "Whether leadership skills are innate or acquired through practice has been a topic of discussion . From my perspective , through extensive training , people can become leaders . On the one hand , some individuals are born leaders , being gifted with traits that are predictive of a good commander . Qualities such as perception , assertiveness , self-confidence , and courage can be inherited and observed in families of leaders . For example , many conglomerates nowadays are family-owned , meaning that chairmanship is passed down from one generation to another in a bloodline . Some of the most notable names are Walmart , which belongs to the Walton family , Samsung , which is owned by the Lee family , and Prada , which has been run by members of the Prada family . Under leadership of the talented heirs , these businesses have flourished and became powerful names in their respective fields . On the other hand , I side with the view that leadership is a learned quality . Numerous required skills of a leader can be practiced through extensive training and hands-on experience . Take Adam Khoo for example . When Adam was at a young age , he was considered a dull-witted , lazy , and apathetic child . Nevertheless , under guidance from a program of Ernest & Young , Adam managed to hone his abilities , started accumulating success , and eventually become Singapore\u2019s youngest millionaire and famed inspirational speaker . These days , programs that are specialized in leadership qualities are abundant , teaching willing proteges in every aspect: decision making , strategy planning , communicating , et cetera . Aspiring leaders can sign up for these programs and gain skills that they are lacking in order to become good commanders", "While some say that students should be admitted based on their academic merits , others argue that schools should select students with varying skill-sets . From my perspective , I strongly support the latter idea as it can create a more holistic approach to education . On the one hand , selecting students on the basis of their abilities is quite advantageous to a certain extent . This is because students who have varying academic merits have different acquisition speed . Therefore , grouping them together in a lesson will cause weaker students confusion and stronger students time . By dividing pupils based on their skill-sets , schools can have more well-paced curriculums . To illustrate , gifted schools in Vietnam all have specialized classes where students can acquire knowledge in their chosen field more intensively , thus advancing in their academic abilities quicker . Meanwhile , pupils in normal classrooms can take time learning these subjects at their own discretion . On the other hand , advocates of integrating students with different aptitudes also have grounds to believe that this approach will facilitate a more holistic learning environment . As all students excel in a different field , what pupils in a mixed class will have is the chance to exchange their knowledge with one another . Students who are well-versed in a subject can aid others in learning by sharing their tips . Moreover , pupils in these classes will be able to expand their knowledge on all subjects , thus becoming more well-rounded citizens , whereas students who study in a specialized class will miss the opportunity to explore their interests in other areas . To summarize , segregating students according to their academic abilities can aid in planning lessons that are suitable for the students\u2019 acquisition speed", "One of the major contributors to pollution is the increasing volume of goods and people transported . While some argue that the government is at fault for this rise , others believe that individuals are responsible . In my opinion , I strongly believe that both parties are to blame for this development . On the one hand , the government is without a doubt responsible for the large volume of traffic , which has grave impacts on the environment . The status of a country\u2019s transportation system relies heavily on its government\u2019s rules and regulations . Once a regime fails to establish effective laws to limit the number of vehicles , be it for personal use or delivery , the traffic will inevitably become congested . Moreover , to solve a problem that affects the community as a whole , in this case that is the rise of transportation , the government has the advantage of being able to apply its solution on a large and even scale , whereas personal effort can vary between different communities . To conclude , the government plays a pivotal role in protecting the environment through its power to curb harmful effects from traffic . On the other hand , advocates of the latter notion also have grounds to believe that people\u2019s lack of awareness contributes significantly to environmental pollution through the rising traffic volume . Many individuals are still of the opinion that solving traffic problems is the government\u2019s responsibility . However , these people do not realize that individuals can take effective measures to help alleviate the problems . To lower the traffic volume , thus decreasing the carbon footprint , people can switch to environmentally friendly modes of transportation such as buses that use biofuel or bike . Moreover , individuals can choose to decrease their frequency and length of travels to eliminate unnecessary trips . By and large , the rising transportation of products and people which affects our habitat adversely is the fault of both the government and individuals", "While some say that participating in team sports is advantageous , others think that players will reap more benefits from individual sports . In my opinion , I support the idea that team sports can support a person\u2019s development better . First of all , team sports are beneficial as they can help foster various desirable qualities in a person . A great team player is oftentimes also a supportive and cooperative friend , and a visionary who is capable of utilizing team members\u2019 strengths when and where appropriate . A case in point is double badminton . To win a match , both players must understand how each other plays . Only in that case can both athletes find a suitable arrangement within a match . Next , both have to place their trust in the other person\u2019s ability to cover the arena . Moreover , team sports can help build great camaraderie , especially for working adults who do not have time to mingle . Nevertheless , individual sports are quite advantageous in some cases . It allows the players to learn more about themselves and focus on improving their ability alone . By having to fully bear the weight of any loss or take credit for any success , the player will grow to be a responsible , self-reliant , and confident person . Take chess for example , in most cases , chess is an individual sport as this game requires complete trust in one\u2019s ability , speed , and the ability to foresight . All of which are difficult to achieve in team sports where many minds are involved in the decision making process", "With the advance of technology , especially in the artificial intelligence (AI) field , many people are concerned about computers being smarter than humans . However , I think there are many benefits to our lives when that happens . Of course , there are legitimate reasons why people have concerns about this development . The first concern is that AI will one day control the human species . This concern , although sounding like it is straight from sci-fi movies , is reasonable . This dystopia happens when computers can teach themselves and develop into a supercomputer , making humans its servants . Another concern is more realistic , saying that computers will take over human\u2019s jobs . When computers are capable of accurately completing mundane tasks , they are capable of replacing human workers . As a result , many people will find themselves unemployed when this happens . However , there are various benefits that intelligent computers bring to humans . The first advantage is that computers utilize resources better than humans do . They complete tasks faster , more efficiently , and have less demand than humans . For example , computers do not need to be paid , be fed , or be accommodated in housing . As a result , using computers as labor will save on resources that can be allocated to human development . The second advantage is that AI brings convenience to humans . The age of AI means less physical labor and more accessible information to other people . For example , humans can see improvements in health since they do not have to work as hard as before . Some applications of AI can even help humans to make better decisions as a result of multiple algorithms . This application can save humans from the tiring process of checking out the pros and cons of a decision . In conclusion , there are both positives and negatives to developing computers that are as intelligent as humans", "There has been recent debate surrounding the age at which children should begin formal education: while some people argue that children should start as early as 7 years old , others believe they should begin even earlier . I personally contend that although starting early might be economically beneficial for the family in the short run , it might ultimately be a futile endeavour as the children would be unable to absorb the information in the long run . One could argue that by starting children on their path of formal education sooner may help support parents financially . Parents often struggle to arrange babysitters and have to resort to expensive daycares that are of no real benefit to them or their children , and if schooling started earlier , this would be a financial stress they would not have to cope with . Primary education in many Western countries , for example , is free for this reason: it allows parents to save money to spend on other things for their family . However , as children are still in the early developmental stages for the first few years of their lives , \u00a0 they would undoubtedly lack the abilities to understand the things taught to them to a sufficient degree . More specifically , since children may not be capable of recalling their lessons , time and money spent on them would simply be wasted . Most adults today , for example , will find it almost impossible to recall what they have learnt in primary school . It could be argued that these early years of a children\u2019s life should instead be spent being emotionally bonded with the parents instead of being taught skills they would forget later on anyway", "While some people claim that newspapers remain the best source of news , others argue that other media are better hubs of information . In my opinion , both sources have their own advantages , yet newspapers are superior thanks to its ability to verify news . On the one hand , other media offer readers many benefits in terms of speed , fee , and reading experience . First of all , people reap the benefits of getting news free of charge and in an instantaneous manner . It does not matter where the reader lives , as long as there is access to the internet , any news from all over the world can be updated on his phone . And plus , as online news channels operate mostly with profits from advertisements , users can oftentimes catch up with happenings for free . Another advantage is that people can have a better reading experience on modern media . Whether the reader is keen on learning news visually or auditorily , there are enough alternatives to cater to their preferences . Such convenience makes obtaining news from other media sources an enjoyable experience . On the other hand , I opine that traditional newspapers remain the best source of information thanks to its accessibility and reliability . This is because traditional newspapers are more accessible for computerphobes and the older generations whose majority are technologically illiterate . Newspapers also have one more advantage over modern media , which is its reliability . While the internet is vulnerable to fake news and false information , newspapers , which have to undergo a rigorous examination by professionals and the government , can offer readers great accuracy . To illustrate , YouTube - one of the largest online platforms in the world - has just been dubbed as a major conduit of disinformation . During the US presidential election , multiple false narratives were spread around in order to mislead voters using this channel", "While some believe that children should be free to make mistakes , others argue that preventive measures should be taken by parents to ensure that children do nothing wrong . In my opinion , I side with the latter notion . To begin with , hampering children from causing mishaps is advantageous to an extent . First , it can prevent mortality when it comes to dangerous situations such as touching a naked wire with wet hands or crossing the road without looking at the traffic lights . Without parental guidance , children may perform these actions and harm themselves , which could be extremely probable among toddlers who have not had full control of their actions and proper understanding of their surroundings . Therefore , children should be educated on essential knowledge for survival before they have any chance to hurt themselves . On the other hand , advocates of allowing children to make mistakes freely also have grounds to believe why this practice is beneficial . Firstly , children will learn to become responsible . As children face consequences from their choices , the lessons learnt will stay with them longer . This is because the repercussions can instill fear of the wrongdoings into children and prevent them from taking similar courses of action . Another point is that having the autonomy to make mistakes will equip children with sharper minds . To be more specific , having to come up with a solution for their mishaps will help children develop problem solving skills and build their confidence should these resolutions prove to be useful", "Ancestral lineage research has been argued by many people to be important in recent times , whilst there are also those who believe it is a fruitless endeavour . In this essay , I will seek to show why I believe that whilst both views have their merits , knowing more about one\u2019s family can be beneficial for those who have been estranged from their roots . Firstly , family history is of no real use in our modern world in terms of economic advantages . Gone are the days of delineating heirs and \u201cpure bloodlines\u201d , and being a son or daughter of a past monarchy means little in most countries today . Concerning oneself with a long lost past , rather than looking ahead and tending to the generations we have now is a waste of the precious time we have to engage and learn from the generations that are still around us . Learning that one is part Chinese or Korean , for example , does not ultimately change who they are as a person or who they should associate with . On the other hand , learning about ancestry is a way of feeling closer to one\u2019s own family , for it is a way of seeing the roots of one\u2019s own family tree and honouring where we come from . This could potentially be of great comfort to orphans , or those who do not know who their parents are . DNA tests , for example , have helped many people without family to track down their long lost relatives and discover brothers and sisters they never knew they had . Helping reconnect families can be seen as a positive social impact of ancestral lineage research", "While some believe that new houses should be built in an identical style to the existing ones in the area , others argue that people should have freedom to design their houses to their own liking . For me , I strongly support the latter idea . On the one hand , houses constructed in the same design as surrounding buildings can bring the area a sense of uniformity and maintain traditional values , which helps boost the local economy . To illustrate , in Hoi An - a famed ancient city in Vietnam that is known for its touristy streets filled with old houses , all the buildings are required to duplicate the style of age-old ones in the area . This is to preserve the ancient look , which is one of the city\u2019s main attractions . Even international brands such as Starbucks have to conform to this obligation . On the other hand , I side with the view that how a house is designed should lie with the owners alone and not the authorities . To begin with , a traditional design may cause inconveniences . For instance , a modern family of five would find it difficult to live in a single-storey house with limited land area . Therefore , if the government prohibits buildings with multiple storeys , the family would have to live in discomfort . Furthermore , a design from another time may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea . Being able to reside where they feel content is anyone\u2019s individual liberties , thus , being forced to live in a house whose design they dislike would be unreasonable . In conclusion , although there are sound reasons why newly built houses should mirror the area\u2019s existing architectural style , I believe that it is best that people have authority over their own houses\u2019 design", "Whether people should be able to freely choose the sports or activities they want to partake in has become a topic of discussion . While some people argue that dangerous sports should be restricted , I firmly believe that the decision should lie with the players . On the one hand , it is true that dangerous sports can come with several risks to the participants . Players always face life-threatening perils once they decide to take part in extreme sports , especially those that involve highly specialized gears , namely skydiving , motor-racing , or mountain climbing . However experienced the participants are , though rare , chances are that the required equipment can malfunction , thus causing the participants fatal wounds or even deaths . For instance , in May , 2021 , a first-time skydiver and his experienced instructor were hospitalized due to parachute malfunctions in McLaren Vale , Australia . On the other hand , I firmly advocate for the idea that players should have the autonomy to partake in any sport . To start with , one\u2019s well-being is first and foremost within their individual liberties , therefore , banning a person from chasing their passion is unreasonable , especially when they have fully acknowledged the threats that come with it . For adrenaline junkies , extreme sports give them pleasure . Preventing them from sports such as skydiving or snowboarding equals taking away their source of happiness . Moreover , in reality , the preparation for these dangerous sports is always painstaking in order to reduce the chance of mortality . For example , one would need to pass a skydiving certification course if they wish to skydive solo", "Given the trillions of dollars being poured in advertising yearly around the world , many believe that the industry has had a negative impact , while others hold that it has benefited society at large . In my opinion , although there are arguments to suggest that advertising can be beneficial , such as supporting the economy , it nonetheless creates a materialist society that cares less about the wellbeing of the poor , thus being overall negative . Advertising , on the one hand , is an industry which can help connect consumers and businesses through the dissemination of information . Individuals with a certain set of demand can pinpoint which products they want to buy , and from where through advertisements . In addition , businesses can set themselves apart from their competitors by showcasing what makes their products unique , thereby attracting more buyers . Overall , this helps to facilitate more monetary transactions , stimulating the economy and benefitting buyers and sellers alike . This is the reason why for instance the advertising industry is so large , and why it employs as many people as it does . On the other hand , I argue that advertising creates a materialist culture by equating products with happiness . Advertising today works by making associations between certain products with positive emotions or traits . For instance , whereas Coca Cola is functionally a sugary drink which can cause a plethora of negative health effects , its mass advertising campaigns result in it being associated with summer and sports . As a result , instead of looking inwards and becoming happier through working on ourselves , individuals increasingly equate buying and consuming more with being happier . This in turn creates more waste and an inefficient use of resources , as the money spent on advertising and buying unnecessary products is diverted from more pressing issues", "There is an ongoing debate about whether younger generations should follow social customs or behave independently of these traditions . While individualism is important , I believe that people should follow traditions that are cultural and helpful to them . It is reasonable why many adults insist that their children follow traditions . Firstly , most traditions are derived from living experiences of older generations and were passed down for centuries; so they help maintain relationships with one another . For example , a person who adopts Vietnamese traditional table manners and politeness is considered educated and emotionally intelligent . Secondly , following culturally-related traditions helps a person shape one\u2019s cultural identity . For example , many second-generation Vietnamese Americans still celebrate Tet as a way to identify themselves . On the other hand , I can understand why these days , there is an emphasis on individualistic development . One reason is that some traditions are now outdated in modern society . For example , the traditional mindset that women are responsible for all housework is purely sexist by today\u2019s standards . As a result , people are fighting for the right to develop based on their judgment . Another reason is that suppressing individualism can also inhibit creativity and innovation . For example , forcing contemporary artists to learn traditional instruments or play these music genres can limit their potential to develop in other aspects . In conclusion , I believe that people should freely behave as individuals , but they should still follow traditions that they find suitable and helpful", "Today , with the increasing rate of health problems due to sugary foods , governments worldwide have introduced special taxes on sugar . While I think this action is mainly effective , there are some downsides that we need to consider . I agree that there should be a special tax on sugary foods and beverages . Firstly , sugar is the culprit for multiple health issues . For example , sugary foods can first lead to obesity and dental problems . A more serious case of overindulgence of sugary foods and beverages can ultimately lead to diabetes , which almost cannot be entirely cured . Another reason why I think sugary foods should be taxed is this tax is a way to relieve the burden on healthcare systems in the future . Health issues involving sugar usually show themselves when individuals are older , and statistically , poorer . This demographic's healthcare is usually subsidized by the government , which is why taxing sugary foods helps to balance out healthcare costs . However , I can understand why people are against this special tax law . Special taxes on harmful items have been placed on tobacco and alcohol products , for example . Despite this effort , many people are consuming these products regularly . Therefore , many think taxing sugary foods will not make a difference . Some also point out that putting taxes on sugar , without educating people on the reasons for it , can be seen as oppressive to many . For example , only health-conscious people are aware of the dangers high levels of sugar bring . The general public cannot fully understand this , so taxing sugary drinks out of the blue seems oppressive and not transparent . Extreme people may even makeup conspiracies that this tax will only benefit the government", "As the effects of climate change are getting more significant , many think businesses will collapse , while others predict that they will flourish . I believe that whether a business would do well depends on its target market . It is undeniable that many businesses will face challenges as climate change proceeds . Firstly , those that involve or exploit natural resources will be the first to face the consequences of climate change . For example , the entire agriculture industry will most definitely suffer from constant natural disasters , while mines and oil drills worldwide deal with resource depletion . Secondly , transportation businesses will be challenged with multiple hardships . Natural disasters , like earthquakes , flooding , or heavy storms , will cause various road blockages , delaying the transportation of both goods and people . However , stating that all businesses will collapse is a pure exaggeration since many will flourish during these times . Firstly , those that promote sustainability can expand their market . This growth is because as climate change takes effect , humans will gradually have to change their consumption behaviors . These are businesses that sell products like reusable water bottles , portable wooden utensils packs , or biodegradable cosmetics . Secondly , I believe tech companies that research alternatives to fossil fuels will become the top players . For example , Tesla is now doing extremely well with its electric cars . In Vietnam , the VinGroup corporation can also collect more profits from its electric scooter products . In conclusion , there is a collapse of major businesses when climate change hits", "Today , there is an ongoing debate surrounding the stage in which people\u2019s personalities are most crucial: while some believe that it is the formative years before they attain formal education , others believe that their teenage years are the most important . In my opinion , while our adult years certainly have an effect on our future lives , most of our personality will have been formed by the early periods of our lives . On the one hand , one could argue that as we get older , our outlook on life is most affected as our personalities have already been formed and we can now have the ability to make our own mistakes . By learning certain things about ourselves , and what to do and what not to do , we will assimilate into wider society better . For instance , important life skills such as doing taxes or investing into a retirement fund can only be communicated to an adult , since children would not be able to understand what is being taught to them . Thus , young adults are in the best position to learn about the world and how to live within it . On the other hand , I believe that one\u2019s childhood greatly affects their outlook on life . Numerous studies have shown that a healthy upbringing can result in more functional people , whereas the opposite case would likely lead to individuals being more susceptible to mental health issues later in life . Furthermore , when children are taught certain skills at a young age , when their brains have yet to mature , this could paradoxically lead to them being able to learn it quicker . For instance , we can see that young children are able to learn languages much quicker than full grown adults", "As the population of many developed countries around the world starts to age , many believe that the government should do more to support the eldery , while others contend that funds should be redirected to provide for better education for young people . In my opinion , governments should consider helping both groups , since doing so would contribute to the overall wellbeing of society . On the one hand , young people are the future workforce of society , and investment in this demographic will help improve economic growth . By providing more well rounded education , foreign companies will be more enticed to invest in a particular country , and as such , an educated populace can lead indirectly to more foreign direct investment . An obvious case example is China , where a strong state-funded education sector resulted in a very high literacy rate and subsequently high economic growth when the economy liberalized . On the other hand , one might argue that although older people might not contribute to society as much , society still owes a debt to them . This firstly is because old people have contributed to the economy previously , and should therefore be entitled to have a retirement fund . Furthermore , by supporting the elderly , the government takes off some of the stress that is experienced by younger people who still have to take care of their families . Thus , greater investment in retirement homes , for instance , can help all age demographics of a society", "When children commit crime , many believe that they themselves should be punished , where there are those who argue that the parents of the children should face legal justice instead . In my opinion , parents should not be personally liable to the wrongdoing of their children , since they themselves have not committed a crime , and cannot therefore be responsible . Some may argue that since children have not fully developed their mental faculties , that behaviours performed by them must be copied from their parents . Therefore , parents that teach their kids anti social behaviour therefore shoulder some of the blame for their child misbehaving . Studies have shown that children growing up in abusive households , for example , are more likely to grow up having psychological issues of their own . Thus , it might be suggested that since children\u2019s cognitive functions are moulded by their parents , they should be punished instead of the child . On the other hand , to punish the parents of children implies that the child has no free will . Although parenting does play a part in individual action , it must be pointed out that individuals also have a degree of autonomy (this of course by age; a four year old does not have the same level of cognition as a seventeen year old) . Furthermore , to convict parents of crimes their children commit would be to indict them for acts they simply have not done - it could also be the case that the child was raised perfectly well , and still decided to become a criminal . Therefore , since it cannot be proven that a child\u2019s criminal action is purely because of their parents instead of their own volition , their parents should not be punished", "With the rising popularity of foreign films , many are concerned whether this is a positive or negative development towards local culture . While I think that in extreme cases , watching foreign films is harmful , I still believe that this has generally a positive impact . Consuming foreign films is , surprisingly , beneficial for the local culture . Firstly , foreign films introduce to the audience a new culture or a social problem . From this , many can have crucials insights into their society and culture . For example , the Korean film Parasite presents class conflict through a setting that resonates with many Vietnamese families . After watching the movie , many reported being able to identify class conflicts in their community . Moreover , when filmmakers watch critically acclaimed foreign films , they can take notes on the techniques . For example , Song Lang is a Vietnamese movie that adopts foreign cinematographic techniques to tell a story about preserving a form of Vietnamese art . However , I can understand why many people are concerned about foreign movies being detrimental to local culture . The first reason is the audience can mimic certain features of the film , which sometimes are not appropriate in the local culture . For example , Vietnamese students may want to dye their hair and dress more revealingly after watching movies set in US high schools , despite the action being against school rules . Another reason is that the popularity of foreign movies can squash the growth of domestic ones . Many Vietnamese directors have expressed this concern , saying that even if an interesting Vietnamese film appears in the cinema , younger audiences tend to prefer foreign ones", "A discussion today involves whether or not art should be practiced by everyone , rather than only by a talented few . In my opinion , given that art is not only a tool of self-expression but also a medium of talent , the widespreadness of its production helps to provide a diversity of viewpoints . On the one hand , some individuals may argue that by leaving art to talented people , less time is wasted by those whose art would not get attention anyway . These people might argue that some individuals are simply hard-wired to create good art , and as such , no amount of training can allow those less talented to reach the same level as them . On the other hand , it could be said that art might simply need to challenge people\u2019s perspectives instead of purely being a showcase of skill and talent . It could be argued that traditionally , those who are able to pursue art are people from more affluent backgrounds , as such , despite their works being of high quality , they nonetheless can often be repetitive . Thus , many artists might use their art as a valuable tool of self-expression , although it might not necessarily take a lot of talent to make it . For instance , one of the most visited art museums in London is the Tate Modern , containing many art pieces that are simply swirls of one colour on a canvas", "With the increasing population in urban areas , many cities have opted for either developing vertical housing or horizontal housing . I do not think there is a one-size-fits-all solution and that it depends on the city . The vertical development style means focusing on building apartments to house people . Because an apartment building can host many people , this option will reduce the average rent and house prices . It is most suitable for densely populated cities , like New York , Hong Kong , or Ho Chi Minh City . Also , a city like this has the benefit of providing convenience and a sense of community . Most apartments are pre-furnished and near supermarkets and schools , have security systems and reception areas . These features make life in them comfortable . Some apartments also have Facebook groups to connect residents by letting their kids hang out with each other or going for a walk together . However , a horizontal development style , which means building on vast land areas , would be more suitable for cities with decentralized residents . What this means is that their citizens are not clumping up near the central areas but rather scattered out in the outskirts . These areas will have lower land prices due to availability . A benefit of living here is that there is more privacy since there will not be as many neighbors as there are in apartments . Another advantage is that children will have more spaces due to houses having a backyard or a garden . This feature is essential to a child's development because they tend to be more active and nature-loving . In conclusion , both building taller buildings and building over vast land areas are effective methods to accommodate the population due to their benefits", "As scientists give out warnings about the potential global food crisis , many people wonder whether the key to tackling this problem lies in food aid or proper education . I believe that both are valid approaches , but each would solve the problem differently . The most considerable benefit that food aid brings to the table is that it solves food hunger straightforwardly and quickly . Donating food to famine areas is the solution that requires the least resources to help people with food insecurity . For example , when people face chronic food shortages in Vietnam , usually after natural disasters , food banks are created and are readily donated to by mostly everyone . It requires only human resources to manage and distribute the food . Another benefit is that it is the solution suitable for people in underdeveloped countries . Many people there do not fully appreciate or can afford proper education on food security . As a result , providing them with food aid is a better solution because that is something they can comprehend . However , in the long run , I believe that education will solve world hunger , due to various reasons . Firstly , only education and research can guarantee to prevent food shortages for many ongoing decades . The result of education will be more higher-yield crops , resistive solutions to climate change , and fair trade , which are all factors that reduce food insecurity . Secondly , education can solve the core issues of global hunger . Food aid is only the chronic solution to the problem , which means it is not addressing the roots of food shortages . With adequately funded research into the phenomenon , scientists can come up with solutions to develop sustainable agriculture and high-efficient farming practices , which will eradicate famine for good", "The debate over which is more fundamental to athletic success , physical power or mental endurance , is one that has been long contested . I personally believe that the type of sport at play determines which component becomes more important , and as such , one cannot definitively say which factor is more important to sport as a whole . On the one hand , some would argue that in more physical sports , brute strength is the predominant determiner of success . Sports were initially designed to showcase the physical attributes of its participants , and therefore comes at no surprise that strength is an important component for many of them . This is especially true for activities that demand a high level of endurance , such as marathons or swimming , as a small difference in fitness could make a crucial difference to completion time -\u00a0 famous athletes in these sports hence put more time in physical training , such as weightlifting and running drills , rather than mental training alone . On the other hand , it could be said that team sports require mental abilities as well as physical ones . More specifically , the ability to plan the next move and communicate with teammates is crucial , since organisation is usually what differentiates the best teams from the worst . The mental involvement of sports such as football and basketball allows it to be a battle of wit as much as being a physical contest . This is how footballers such as Lionel Messi , despite being small in stature , is able to flourish on a football pitch: he is able to utilise his ability to link up with his teammates", "Many people today often debate the relevance of studying the past to current behavior . There are those who believe that this is a fruitless endeavor , since we should focus on the unique circumstances of today rather than the different nature of society in the past . On the other hand , I argue that the problems we face as a society have often already been faced by previous generations , and as such , history will have something to teach us . There are those who believe that due to the ever-changing material conditions of society , we should focus more on the present in order to solve issues . Over the last 100 years , technology has transformed society to a point where the problems we face today can arguably be said to be much more complex than the past: to limit ourselves to previous solutions instead of delving into modern problems is the the equivalent of an intellectual straightjacket . For example , issues such as climate change could be said to be unique to our current age and will require us to examine our own society . On the other hand , as Mark Twain once said: \u201cHistory doesn't repeat itself , but it does rhyme\u201d . This means that even though the problems we face might not be identical , it is nonetheless fundamentally similar to what previous generations of humans have undergone . Therefore , studying history allows us to not repeat the same mistakes of the past . For example , since the 1940s , we have learned never to go to war on a worldwide scale again , kicking off a period of unprecedented peace", "With the advancement of technology , many people think online materials are sufficient for teaching , and printed materials have no place in schools today . I believe this matter depends on both the subject taught and the level of education of students . Online materials are the solution to protect the environment while still providing convenience for both students and teachers . This type of learning material usually appears in higher education because there are lots of students in courses that require a heavy load of materials . If they are all printed , it would be a considerable amount of paper waste , so online materials are the solution . Another benefit is that online materials come in many forms , such as audio , interactive diagrams , or graphs . It will be more helpful than printed ones for engineering courses and graphic design ones . Also , it is easier to store and share online materials with your peers because it can be done on a laptop and takes up no physical space . However , that is not to say that printed material has no place in modern education . This type of material is especially suitable for classes that require memorization and annotation . Many subjects , like maths or physics , are hard for note-taking on laptops because they involve various scientific notations , which is why maths is taught by strictly printed materials . Studies also show that memorization is more efficient when students read from printed materials rather than digital ones . Another reason is that printed materials are more user-friendly . This advantage is significant because many teachers and students are not tech-savvy enough to work with digital materials . For example , many underprivileged students in middle and high schools still struggle with using computers due to not having prior exposure . In conclusion , I think that online materials are suitable for higher education , or for courses that require perusing lots of materials", "\ufeffCommuting is becoming an increasingly time-consuming activity for workers and students alike , and discussions have revolved around whether this is a good thing . I personally do not see how this development could be something beneficial to the current or future workforce , since despite allowing additional leisure time for some , it will mean worse mental health problems for the majority . Some could argue that longer commutes may provide the workers and students with the ability to decompress prior to arriving at work , as it gives them the time to rest between potential domestic troubles and workplace issues . This moment of rest may actually be beneficial as it would ensure workers and students do not arrive at work burnt out and unfit to work , boosting their productivity . For example , many workers today take the time out in their morning commute to listen to podcasts and music or reply to emails . On the one hand , long commutes and inflexible work hours might result in the worker and student losing out on sleep , resulting in them arriving at the office or school tired and not nearly as productive as they could be . This is further compounded when the worker or student must sleep at earlier hours , affecting their personal and domestic duties , such as being able to spend less time with their family . This explains why longer working hours have been shown to have a negative effect on mental health , which is unwanted for both the individual and the institution they are a part of", "There are many people who have protested the conditions of zoos and demand that they should be shut down , as animals are subject to appalling conditions inside artificial captivity , while others believe that the institution of zoos can be beneficial to the conservation of wild animals . In my view , zoos may be the last resort for many species as the practice of poaching continues to threaten their survival , and should therefore be maintained . On the one hand , many animal activists do have a point in arguing that zoos can be cruel . They are often mockeries of the animals natural habitats , and far too small to accommodate the animals that inhabit them . A lot of the animals in zoos are not as in shape as they would be in the wild , since they have regular feeding hours and no longer have any need to hunt . This in turn leads to them becoming unhealthy and living shorter lives . Many captive gorillas , for example , have been observed to have a lower lifespan than their free-roaming counterparts . On the other hand , zoos prevent poachers from killing more animals , for they provide security that would not exist in the wild . Poaching has been a huge issue in recent years , and has contributed to a number of species going extinct . Zoos , meanwhile , are controlled places where the animals are under observation and protected by security at all times . Many zoos are currently being used in Africa in order to protect endangered species of rhino , for example , and as they have been shown to save many species from the cusp of extinction , they are a necessary evil for wildlife to continue to exist", "There could be a debate surrounding whether advertising is effective , with opponents arguing that it is now too ubiquitous to actually have any impact . In my opinion , advertising is a large waste of money , since most advertisements are not paid attention to . On the one hand , there are those who argue that the returns on advertising for companies is worthwhile , since advertising can help us differentiate between the same types of products . If advertising is not effective , for instance , it is questionable as to why companies still continue to do it . Thus , one might suggest that the billions of dollars poured into marketing yearly , for instance , is a testament to the ongoing effectiveness of advertising . On the other hand , it could be said that the large amounts of money invested into advertising does not show its efficacy , but actually proves that it is rather cost-ineffective . With the constant bombardment of ads today , it could be said that many people are increasingly becoming averse to them , and as such , more and more money has to be invested in order to grab the consumer\u2019s attention . Recent studies , for instance , show that millennials and Gen Z respond much less to ads , preferring to use things such as Adblock on their browsers instead", "\ufeffCapitalizing on local cultural customs in order to appeal to tourists has always been a heated topic as many protest the effects this development might have on their cultural heritage . Personally , I disagree with the practice as I do not think they can honestly preserve the culture and heritage of local groups , albeit some exceptions to minority culture should be made . As a point of consideration , when tourists invest in local cultural traditions , these traditions become a production that must be put on in order to please these tourists , leading to the loss of authenticity over time . Tourism places unnecessary stress on local customs , for they must appeal to tourists for their ideas about the culture and fulfill this expectation . Through a gradual process of change , there might not be any semblance of the old tradition left . For instance , many tourist destinations in East Asia have had to transform their food and services to fit Western taste , and as such , loses the authenticity that pulled people towards them in the first place . On the other hand , exceptions can nonetheless be made when it comes to displaced natives living on reservations . These people have been forced off their lands in the past , and often forced to adapt to colonizers , and their cultures often have been repressed in the past to the extent that it may be nearly extinct . In these situations , these once sacred and important cultural rituals can only be kept alive by the interest of tourists . This is why many minority people actively welcome visitors to explore their culture and customs as a way to preserve them", "With the advancement of space technology , people are beginning to venture out to space to send messages looking for life . Although many people can point out the drawbacks of this action , I think it is generally beneficial to the human race . Regardless of the search's results , humans can benefit from this advancement . Firstly , by sending signals to space to look for life , scientists can also learn more about the universe . For example , many celestial bodies , such as massive black holes , galaxies , or earth-like planets , have been discovered when pulsating signals . Secondly , searching for a sign of life outside of the Earth can be educational for us . Suppose we find a life that had existed years ago but is now extinct: we can learn from their extinction to prevent the same destiny from happening to ourselves . Moreover , if we do detect signals from a superior species , we then have enough time to prepare ourselves , either to hide from them or to fight back . In both cases , it is rewarding . However , I have to admit that there are dangers in sending messages into space . One is that we have no way of knowing if the other species is non-threatening . Many theories , like the Fermi paradox , have pointed out that the reason why we cannot reach the other species is that it is so intelligent that our signals mean nothing . An analogy often used is that we are ants living on the sidewalk , not knowing that humans exist on the other side . Likewise , the alien species might also have the power to exterminate humans if we disturb them . Another drawback is that even if we manage to meet an inferior species , this does not guarantee that it will not become superior to us in the long run . For example , through an exchange of technology , it can learn faster than humans , thus ruling our planet", "Nowadays , many people think that higher education is only for people with the highest marks , while others do not agree . I believe that while rigorous universities should not lower their standards , private universities can still accept those who are willing to pay . On the one hand , accepting only top scorers guarantees that the university\u2019s reputation is maintained . This policy is what current top universities , such as the Seoul National University in South Korea or the Ho Chi Minh City Medical School , are doing . As a result , students and professors of these universities feel motivated by pride to put more effort into their studies and research to continuously bring more achievements to the university . Another advantage of this policy is that this creates an environment that is spear-headed towards learning and researching . This environment will incentivize students and professors to undergo academic research . For example , teaching in schools like these will be easier for professors as they need not spend much time on the materials , so they can devote more time to nurturing innovative ideas . As a result , more students will have a chance to put their academic knowledge into use . On the other hand , I think that universities should not deny anyone with a willingness to study . An entrance exam does not fully reflect a student\u2019s academic performance since many factors can lead to low scores . For example , a student may come from an underprivileged area and could not afford tutoring centers , thus not having enough materials to practice . As a result , they tend to perform more poorly than students who have these resources at hand . Another point is that everyone should have a right to access education . This mindset is prevalent from primary to high school and should be the same for higher education . A solution for this might be to have universities with high acceptance rates , which ensures that top scorers can enroll in prestigious universities but low scorers can also learn if they are willing to pay", "Building the habit of recycling is one of the recommended practices for everyone living in today\u2019s societies . However , many wonder whether schools or parents should be the ones mainly responsible for developing this practice . Although I think both can contribute to this , schools should play a more vital role . However , that is not to say that parents should not be involved in teaching children to recycle . Firstly , children usually mimic their parents\u2019 behaviors , both good and bad ones . As a result , if parents do not promote this habit by regularly practicing it , children will see that they do not need to do so . Secondly , because the process of recycling products mostly takes place in a domestic environment , parents should teach their children how to recycle and reuse in their homes . For example , parents can start by recycling groceries packaging , like oil bottles , plastic bags , or egg cartons . Nevertheless , I believe that schools play a more crucial role in educating children on recycling . Firstly , schools are more open-minded and environmentally-conscious environment . For example , many parents from older generations do not believe in recycling and think of it as a waste of time . As a result , schools should provide children with a thorough analysis of why recycling is critical and the best ways to recycle . Secondly , children also develop habits through peer pressure , which is an element prevalent in schools . For example , when seeing that other students are recycling , children will be motivated to do so , regardless of their beliefs . In conclusion , it is undeniable that families play a significant role in educating children on recycling", "The topic of whether governments should invest money in training top athletes or building sports facilities for the public is always a controversial one . I believe that in a developing country like Vietnam , the investment should first go to the public , then train top athletes . There are various reasons why I think governments should prioritize investing in building sports facilities for the public . Firstly , this money is from citizens\u2019 taxes , and it is only fair if they receive direct benefits from these tax payments . As a result , building facilities that can help them maintain their shape is more important than investing in only a few individuals . Secondly , the consequences of not investing enough in public sports facilities are more critical than those in top athletes . For example , if citizens do not have space to exercise , they run a higher risk of developing more illnesses . These illnesses are a burden to society . Because of this , it is more beneficial for countries with limited budgets to invest in the public . However , that is not to say that top athletes should not receive any investment at all . Firstly , professional athletes are the face of the country they represent at international sports competitions , like the World Cup or the Olympics . Many foreigners associate countries with their most successful athletes , such as South Korea with top archers or the US with top swimmers . Secondly , famous athletes serve as both entertainment and motivation for the public . For example , many enjoy watching sports because athletes remind them of human\u2019s maximum physical capacity , thus motivating them to exercise . Moreover , many find the number of hard work athletes put into their training and performance inspiring . As a result , people feel incentivized to work harder", "Regarding cultural activities , some people propose a complete cut in government funding , while others argue that culture is an indispensable aspect of our society . I strongly support the latter view because we can significantly benefit from cultural activities . Works of art such as songs or poems are sometimes deemed as unnecessary because they do not satisfy any materialistic need . To some people , it seems unfair to use the government budget for recreational purposes while millions are still living in poverty . Proponents of this view demand the government stop funding art and cultural programs; this way , people wanting leisure will have to pay for their own needs . However , I would say cultural activities are so important to our society; they warrant dedicated support at a national level . First , it is simply wrong to think that art and culture do not contribute to social welfare . Aside from the decorative value , artistic works also have their practical functions; an aesthetic building embraces both functionality and harmony with the surrounding area , for example . Second , art and cultural activities are tools to promote social cohesion - the bond between people and people . Throughout history , cultural festivals such as Halloween have played a pivotal role in strengthening the community and providing entertainment . Therefore , it is safe to say that cultural funding by the government brings benefits to not only the rich but also the poor", "Some people argue that in modern society , technological advancements are increasing the gap between the wealthy and the poor while others believe that technology is decreasing the gap between them . In my opinion , while certain innovations are inaccessible to the poor because of their high cost , certain technologies are available to all people in society and help reduce the gap between the rich and the poor . Some inventions and discoveries decreased the gap between people of different income levels . This is because they are accessible to all people due to their availability at cheaper rates . For example , internet technology is available to almost all sections of society . It is affordable to all people , and certain places such as railway stations , bus stations , and airports are WiFi hotspots where the internet is freely available . Online shopping facilities , e-learning opportunities and social networking sites are available to both affluent and poor people in society and they decrease the gap between the rich and the poor . However , certain advancements in technology are not affordable for the poorer sections of society . In fact , new drugs , diagnostic procedures , and even modern medicines are very costly . Therefore , only rich people can access these treatments and improve their health by spending only a small portion of their income . For example , affluent people who developed cancer took treatment with a special kind of protein which was very expensive but had fewer side effects compared to conventional chemotherapy . Poor people , on the other hand , have to spend all of their money for conventional treatments and yet there is no guarantee that their condition will improve", "\ufeffThe relocation of enterprises to the suburbs has been promoted by many governments due to the rising issues of transportation and housing in central places . From my perspective , the benefits of this practice surpass its drawbacks . On the one hand , the alteration of enterprises\u2019 places would exert negative effects on their interests relating to the unavailability of resources and potential customers . Chief among these is that infrastructure and human resources are not immediately accessible in the suburbs . For example , major banks would suffer from inadequacies of well-trained employees because they are out of reach for high-quality graduates from many universities . Not to mention that enterprises moving to the outskirts would impede their businesses as profits cannot be generated easily . For example , the failure in attracting customers of high-end clothes stores results in their lower revenues , which negatively impacts the businesses\u2019 survival in the market . On the other hand , the moving of businesses to the countryside plays a pivotal role in reducing the number of over-crowding related issues in the cities and employment problems in the countryside . Concerning the former advantage , the change in companies\u2019 operation place requires their workers to move from the center to the outskirts , which would significantly decrease the amount of transportation and population in the central areas . Therefore , congestion and rising housing prices would be less problematic , thereby enhancing city citizens\u2019 living standards . In addition , businesses moving to rural areas creates more job opportunities for workers who live in those places . By joining the workforce , those individuals can generate more gains , which is paramount in lessening income inequality between rural and urban citizens . In conclusion , the governmental encouragement of altering companies\u2019 places of business may cause difficulties for businesses due to their inaccessibility of resources and lower chances of stimulating profits", "Technological advancement has encouraged the proliferation of ample high-tech means of recreation . From my perspective , although some regarded this phenomenon as positive , I deemed it more detrimental . It goes without saying that the application of technology in pastime activities is favourable in terms of its diverse categories of entertainment and widespread accessibility . Obviously , nowadays , people have a variety of choices regarding the preferred means of entertainment , ranging from films , games or performances . Thus , this diversification would definitely enrich people's mental and spiritual lives . Moreover , due to their availability , the widespread accessibility of technological leisure activities has been enhanced . For example , people owing digital devices such as smartphones can access both online and offline games at ease within their convenience . However , I opine that the dependence on technology for free time amusement is more disadvantageous due to its adverse impacts on health as well as on intimate relationships in a community . Regarding the former , it is true that recreational activities based on technology mostly require people to sit for long periods of time , which promotes a sedentary lifestyle . As a consequence , the number of individuals suffering from eye strain or obesity has increased significantly . Concerning the second drawback , the high level of participation in technological entertainment poses the risk of reducing the quality of face-to-face interaction , thereby damaging the strong bond among people including friends and family . In conclusion , the increasing reliance on technology for recreation is beneficial in terms of its variety as well as accessibility", "Many people are currently proposing a solution to solve problems in the local area: have young people do volunteer , unpaid work to help people in their neighborhood . Although there are some drawbacks to this policy , I believe it is generally beneficial to society . There are various benefits to this mandatory volunteer work . Firstly , it will help young people develop a sense of responsibility and community . By helping out people with whom they are familiar when growing up , they will feel more thankful and personally connected with their neighborhood . Secondly , through unpaid volunteer work , young people can significantly alleviate social problems and improve the quality of life in their community . Younger people nowadays are more open-minded and creative , which means when they channel these strengths into solving local problems , new solutions will arise . For example , many have developed group chats on social media to create an exercise-buddy program , encouraging people to do more physical activities . However , there are still some disadvantages associated with this policy . The first drawback is that the time devoted to voluntary work will be an interruption in their studies or their work . Many students can easily forget knowledge learned after just a few months of not continuing their studies . The second drawback is that if this policy is mandatory , it can pose a stressor on the younger generation . For example , many already have multiple responsibilities to tend to , like taking care of their siblings , working for their families , or struggling to study or find a job . Adding yet another one will cause them to carry out the volunteer work carelessly . Some may even publicly object to it , thinking that they are stripped of their freedom . In conclusion , it is undeniable that this policy carries some disadvantages , especially for people in underdeveloped areas", "The extension of human lifespan will result in an increasing number of elderly compared to that of young people . This essay argues that the positive sides of this tendency are eclipsed by the negative ones because , despite familial and societal support from older people , this group of population poses greater risks to the economy and healthcare system . On the one hand , the aging population plays a practical role in providing assistance for young generations in family and society . With regard to the former , full-time working young adults these days tend to rely on older people in childcare , which is proven to lighten financial burden on newly-wedded couples . In Vietnam , for example , there is a majority of grandparents who are in charge of caring for their grandchildren whose parents\u2019 schedules are usually hectic during working hours . On a societal level , seniors have ample life experience passed down from one generation to the next as valuable lessons which are essential in assisting young people to tackle obstacles and guiding them to the right path in life . Thus , the fact that older people will rise in number can be advantageous in helping the younger ones lead a peaceful life and ensure general well-being . Nevertheless , I think that a higher proportion of older people can bring major drawbacks including burdens on economic aspects and health services . Some may say that the elder is no longer regarded as productive workforces of society , thus the growth in number of this group results in a shortage of qualified workers . This may lead to unfortunate consequences such as declining productivity , higher labor costs , and in the end , cause stagnation in the economy . Coupled with this is that the increasing number of senior populations stimulates the demand for healthcare . Allocation of ample amounts of state funds , therefore , have to be distributed to improve services and facilities in the health sector . The practice may create uneven development in the general prosperity of nations as more resources which are supposed to be spent on education , construction , etc . to stimulate the economy , are instead directed towards alleviating pressure on healthcare systems . In conclusion , despite the benefits of providing support for young people in terms of family and society aspects , the increase in the number of old people generates more adverse effects on the national economy and health sector", "Certain individuals are of the opinion that issues may occur once people become patriotic , especially in extreme cases , which is regarded as an adverse tendency . However , another school of thought opines that it is worthy and advantageous to show national loyalty . I think that the demerits of this tendency are eclipsed by its benefits . To begin with , patriotism at its most extreme could be regarded as problematic due to its detrimental impacts on economic and social aspects . With regard to the former , the loyalty that one may express towards their country is attached to a feeling of superiority over other countries . This causes an obstruction in international trade as people regard others from different nations as inferiors; thus , there is no attempt to be made in commercing and exchanging goods worldwide . Turning to the second idea , it is true that in the modern-day , while every nation enjoys equal standing on a global scale , any country putting itself on a pedestal is detrimental to mutual connectivity and often leads to conflict as well as social exclusion of other minorities . Such practice , in extreme cases , maybe the primary cause of terrorism around the globe . However , despite the aforementioned drawbacks , I think that patriotism can be favorable in terms of promoting solidarity and enhancing national independence . Firstly , patriotism plays a crucial role in uniting people living in the same country . The majority of citizens , undeniably , would value communal senses , and eventually , national unity could be obtained . In this case , patriotism can be supposed as a means of protection which safeguards the country from outside terrorists . Furthermore , without national unity , one country may have to accept unfavorable trading conditions that can be dictated by another country . Thus , it is of paramount importance for a nation to stay independent to avoid adverse effects . For instance , authorities should be aware of the number of goods produced within the country to minimize imported products and consequently be under no control", "Stress that peers have exerted on juveniles can be the main contributor to the changes in their demeanor . This essay argues that the benefits are eclipsed by the drawbacks involved because such pressure , despite facilitating behavioral and academic progress , can create detrimental impacts on adolescents\u2019 mental health . The main advantage is that being influenced by those who belong to the same age group or social group could play a crucial role in reinforcing positive habits and attitudes in social and scholastic terms . Some may say that young people usually take others , especially with whom they have close intimacy , as role models . Therefore , if peers can set a good example for their counterparts , they will probably achieve improvement in both academic and social aspects . For example , watching someone of the same age completing the Road to Mount Olympia successfully promoted the desire to be more goal-oriented and fulfill one's own dream of such intellectual accomplishment . Nevertheless , I believe that the disadvantages of peer pressure are more significant because of mental issues arising from this tendency . It is worth mentioning that the stress originating from comparison among children would make them feel inferior to others , which leads to the fear of expressing themselves as well as potential self-distancing from family and friends . This can be an alarming issue as the worst consequence that may follow is suicide . The dramatic increase in youth suicide in Japan can be a good illustration of this as it is recorded that in 2019 , 70% of suicide was among men aged 20 - 44", "Living away from kins is the sole choice of certain people who long for working to make ends meet . This essay argues that the drawbacks are eclipsed by the benefits involved because despite potential emotional breakdown , this practice ensures stable income and developed intellectual faculties . The idea of looking for employment in an unfamiliar place can be disadvantageous in terms of the mental distress that individuals may suffer . Obviously , tremendous pressure from work and a lack of support from all relatives resulted in the tendency of hiding one's inner feelings , whose long-term effect would do more harm than good to his or her mental health . An extreme example of this is the alarming rate of Japanese young adults committing suicide since they are usually overwhelmed by heavy workloads but have no companion to confide in . Notwithstanding the aforementioned arguments , I would argue that the benefits of being job-seekers to living far away from their homeland are of greater importance partly because of decent earnings and partly because of chances to grow . With regard to the former , this relocation provides more opportunities for workers to be employed in their favorable fields and suitable positions . Thus , they would probably be offered competitive salaries and good benefits . Concerning the second advantage , changing temporary residence according to workplace offers frequent exposure to local unique culture and customs . There is a high possibility that this practice would likely enhance one's mentality and broaden his or her horizons as well . To recapitulate , although some people may withstand mental suffering when not living in close proximity to families and friends for the sake of searching for a source of livelihood , this practice provides individuals with wage stability , and ample opportunities to be advanced", "Many educational institutions at the elementary level in certain nations include non-native languages as a compulsory subject in their curriculum . Despite the disadvantages involved , I am of the opinion that this development is generally more favorable . One of the main disadvantages is that implementing non-native languages in elementary education programs may create considerable pressure on young learners . The reason for this is that many students nowadays already have a burdensome volume of schoolwork and a hectic curriculum to follow , they would find it challenging to have spare time if one more subject is added to their already tight schedule . For example , when a primary state school in Japan introduced a new scheme of forcing students to learn foreign languages , it raised a number of objections from parents as they voiced their concern over the paramount amount of stress their children have to suffer from . Nevertheless , I would argue that teaching foreign languages to primary school students is more beneficial in terms of developing their intellectual faculties and improving their future employability . It is true that the acquisition of a new language at the beginning level promotes frequent exposure to diverse and unique cultures . Such experience allows children to gain an enormous wealth of knowledge about others' customs and lifestyles as well as develop an acute awareness of other exotic people . Furthermore , foreign languages are undoubtedly a crucial tool to open more job opportunities . Employers in certain sectors have a tendency to recruit applicants who demonstrate exceptional linguistic competence , which suggests that students possessing expert language skills are more inclined to have chances to work in various fields such as interpretation , diplomacy , aviation , etc . In conclusion , although children have to face pressure from studying more lingual subjects in their very early years of life , the integration of foreign languages in primary school's curriculum has paved the way for enhancing students' capability and career prospects", "That people nowadays have the tendency to skip family meals is a growing trend . From my perspective , this development has more negatives than positives on both the individual and the society . On the one hand , eradicating the practice of family members eating together is quite advantageous to a certain extent . Due to the ability to schedule one\u2019s meal at one\u2019s own discretion , this trend appeals to people with its convenience . Eating with other family members requires people to synchronize their plans to match at a certain time of the day for meals , which proves to be a difficult task as everyone has their own timetables . For example , for families with adults employed in jobs that have different working hours , one from nine-to-five and the other being night shifts , there would be virtually no time where both would meet and dine together . Therefore , it would be more convenient and practical for both parties to eat separately . On the other hand , the trend of people not dining together with their families affects both the individual and the society adversely . First , a shared meal is the perfect opportunity for family members to mingle and tighten their bonds . As a result , if family meals are obliterated , familial bonds will be decimated . For individuals , these bonds are the base of a healthy mindset as people who grow up without storge often suffer from more emotional problems than those who are surrounded by their kins . For society , these family ties are the fundamental units that build up communities . These are the reasons why once family meals are obliterated , leading to weakened bonds between members , the individual and their society will be affected gravely . In conclusion , whether people dine with their families or not has both pros and cons", "That in recent years , open-space offices are replacing working areas with separate rooms has become a hot topic of debate . In my opinion , the positives of this trend overshadow the negatives . On the one hand , open spaces have two drawbacks , which are an increased level of distraction and risks to employee\u2019s health . First , working in a communal space easily drives one to distraction . From noises of phone calls to colleagues conversing , an employee faces loads of disturbances that can cost them their work efficiency . What is more , a communal office space is an ideal environment for diseases to spread . Take the \u201c3 green\u201d model that was employed by various factories during the height of Covid-19 in Vietnam for example , due to the employees living in close proximity , Covid-19 spreaded easily and the model had to be deployed soon . Despite the disadvantages , I believe the advantages of open-plan offices are more considerable . First , an open-space office can facilitate communication and foster friendships between employees . An open space allows employees to communicate with one another more freely and timely . This leads to ideas flowing more effortlessly and innovations to be born more quickly . Furthermore , by working together and having more chances to get to know each other , employees can form stronger bonds , thus boosting the company\u2019s culture . Moreover , open-space offices help save cost on amenities such as printers , scanners , and lockers . Whereas separate offices require a multitude of these equipment , employees who work in an open-plan office can share these utilities . In conclusion , I believe that the advantages of open-plan offices eclipse its drawbacks", "Nowadays , mobile phones can be used to receive business or personal calls anytime . From my perspective , I strongly believe that the positives and negatives of this trend are equal . On the one hand , being able to take phone calls at any time is extremely beneficial . Mobile phones allow people to handle urgent situations anytime and anywhere , and this benefits not only the individuals but large corporations as well . In terms of businesses , mobile phones help them to be available to customers round the clock via hotlines . As a result , customer service will be improved and with that comes increased profits . Regarding individuals , mobile phones allow quick and easy communication with their families and friends , despite the geographical location . Moreover , even on holidays , emergencies at work can be dealt with swiftly using mobile phones . This is especially advantageous in lines of business that require frequent and prompt problem solving such as show business . On the other hand , there are undeniable issues with the ability to use mobile phones at all times . First , mobile phones are great distractions which can interfere with lives outside of work . If a person is regularly disturbed by work messages or phone calls , they can never truly enjoy their time off with their friends and family . Moreover , having to answer to problems at work any time will throw a person off their work-life balance as they are always ready to engage in work . In the long term , stress and declined mental health are to be expected . In conclusion , the advantages of being able to communicate via mobile phones anytime do not eclipse its disadvantages and vice versa", "Nowadays , people tend to store knowledge on the Internet rather than in books . From my point of view , I believe that the positives of this trend outweigh its negatives . To start with , using the internet as a storage for knowledge has two great benefits . First , the internet provides people with quick and easy access to a great variety of information . Whereas in former times , people had to spend much time leafing through numerous pages in search of knowledge , modern people can look for different types of information with just a mouse click . Moreover , with the internet and the help of electronic devices , knowledge is accessible anytime and anywhere . To illustrate , even while running , people can still absorb information from podcasts or audio books , which would be impossible with traditional books . Moreover , the internet allows people to keep more diversified types of knowledge . Since the internet is capable of storing audios and videos , nowadays , film and musical legacies can be stored and shared with our future descendants with ease . Beneficial as it is , storing knowledge online also causes two main problems . Firstly , internet users must be aware of fake news . As anyone can post anything online without verification and repercussions , loads of unreliable information awaits uninformed netizens and supplies them with inaccurate knowledge . This can be dangerous in case the information is health-related or law-related . Secondly , intellectual copyrights are at risk due to the boom of the internet . In recent years , due to how loose cyber laws are , the internet has become a tool for millions of websites to distribute pirated publications in exchange for advertising revenues . These copyright infringements inflict substantial losses on the publishing industry and discourage aspiring authors", "Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , more people are receiving news through online mediums instead of traditional means , such as newspapers and TV programs . Despite some of the drawbacks , I still think this is a positive development . There are some reasons why I think this generally is a positive trend . Firstly , switching from newspapers to an online medium means doing the environment a favor . For example , if a person consumes even one newspaper per day , in total , it is still hundreds of pages of print a week . Reading newspapers would mean cutting down multiple trees and producing ink frequently just for one person's consumption . Secondly , receiving news through websites or online channels gives you more control as to what content you want to view . For example , if you only rely on one TV program for your daily dose of information , you will miss out on the news not covered for that channel , such as international or entertainment news . However , despite these benefits , there are still some considerations to be made when switching to an online news outlet . The first thing is that reading news online can be very distracting due to readers having complete control of the content that he or she reads . For example , many people go online just for a casual read but then find themselves deeply engaged in a discussion thread , thus wasting their time . Secondly , news on the Internet is unedited , which means that the sources of this type of information can be unverifiable . Many have fallen victim to fake news posted on the Internet . In conclusion , saving the environment and being in control of your content are the two main benefits of the development", "Whether or not to seek to increase tourism has been a controversial issue debated by many , with some seeing it as a large potential source of revenue , and others arguing that it ultimately erodes the local culture as more and more investments from both the government and entrepreneurs aim to profit from the tourists . Personally , I agree with the latter sentiment more . Firstly , there are many unscrupulous schemes set forth by travel businesses seeking to exploit local cultures for their own benefit , ultimately preventing the natural evolution of local cultures by freezing the traditions of the past , or at worst , creating a fantasy to enchant the tourists and fulfill their desire for exoticism . Either way , the evolution of these cultural traditions becomes something that is no longer in the hands of the locals but stolen from them . Citizens of cities such as Phuket or Sapa , for instance , often complained that tourism has made the area unrecognizable when compared to its beginnings . Secondly , the rise of mass tourism can actually cause the disillusionment of many tourists who visit countries for an authentic experience of the local culture , as they may come only to find the recreations of local cultures too artificial after decades of intervention by businessmen seeking to monetize ancient traditions . The end result is that tourists may eventually stop coming , and any income produced may start to dry . This has been the case for countries such as Vietnam , whereby the rate of return for visitors is only around 10% , many of whom cite a disappointing experience as a factor", "With the current globalization trend , boundaries between countries are becoming more blurred as people around the world consume the same media . Despite some possible drawbacks of this development , I still think the benefits outweigh the downsides . There are various reasons why this trend is advantageous to the whole society . Firstly , by following news globally , we can learn about social issues happening in other countries and apply the solutions to our own . For example , many Vietnamese , especially teenagers and young adults , were interested in the recent US presidential election . Many people have reported that they became more engaged in political issues in general . As a result , this year\u2019s election in Vietnam saw a peak in engagement among young adults , with many discussions in online forums . Secondly , more people are watching the same media , like Youtube , which can be an opportunity for us to promote our own culture . For example , more international food bloggers and reviewers are going to Vietnam because they saw videos and TV series broadcasted about Vietnamese food on these global media outlets . As a result , the number of tourists to Vietnam has significantly increased . However , I must admit that there are some disadvantages to this trend . Firstly , limiting one\u2019s media consumption to outlets that feature news from around the world can mean being ignorant about local news . For example , a small piece of local information , like a recent robbery , can get lost amongst various news coming from around the world . As a result , many can become insensitive to changes in the local community . Secondly , one might lose one\u2019s cultural identities if following global media outlets carelessly . With the rising trend of the Korean entertainment industries , many people in Vietnam are adapting to the Korean lifestyle , for example . This overall is still a harmless trend , but in extreme cases , it has led to young adults degrading their own cultural identities and chasing after foreign cultures . In conclusion , I understand that there are some disadvantages to this globalization trend in media consumption", "With the advancement of technology , more people are opening accounts for social media and online banking purposes . This has led to the question of whether it is beneficial to put personal information online . I think that , despite the convenience it brings , people should not put their personal information online . On the one hand , I can understand why people would put their personal information online . Firstly , it makes signing up for accounts much more convenient for users . For example , in the past , to open up a stock account , people would have to go to a stock company and complete lots of paperwork . By providing personal information online , people save time doing these registrations . Another benefit is that this makes signing in to these accounts easier for users . Instead of choosing security questions and remembering the answer for them like in the past , nowadays , users only need to provide their phone number or email address to get verified . This feature is useful when someone is trying to sign in to a bank account during an emergency . On the other hand , there are multiple problems with readily providing one\u2019s personal information online . The first one is that , by doing so , the user will become a target for not just material but also identity thefts . Social media accounts are prone to be hacked . Once the thief acquires the person\u2019s address , they can easily break into that person's house , especially with other information already posted on social media , like vacation plans . Even worse , they can impersonate the user to claim insurance . On a less serious note , when users give out their information to the social media company or the bank , there is still a slight chance that these companies will sell it to telesales people . There have been reports that some social media platforms , such as Tiktok , collect and sell user's personal information", "The advancement of technology has profoundly initiated online interaction among individuals via the widespread use of social platforms . This trend plays a pivotal role in keeping in contact and widening a person's social network; however , I am of the opinion that its drawbacks outweigh those aforementioned advantages . On the one hand , the replacement of face-to-face interaction with social media is beneficial in terms of getting in touch with acquaintances as well as broadening personal networks . First of all , it is undeniable that the use of social media allows people to connect to their beloved at ease regardless of geographical location . For example , the application Facebook or Twitter has enabled students studying abroad to contact their family members easily on a daily basis . Furthermore , the proliferation of these online platforms provides people with ample opportunities to make friends with other individuals across the globe . Having international peers is becoming more common as these social sites equip their users with features to find and form friendships with others from other countries . However , I deem the downsides of the substitution of in-person interaction with online tools more disadvantageous . To begin with , it goes without saying that the use of social media would potentially reduce the quality of interpersonal relationships . People have a tendency to use text or show no desire in face-to-face interactions; also , the addiction to screens has been an alarming issue that needs to be addressed . This phenomenon is detrimental as gradually people\u2019s capability of being flexible and creative in using verbal means of communication would significantly be reduced . Besides , the use of social media poses the threat of losing personal information . Obviously , it is compulsory for individuals to register by providing personal data to become users of these platforms , this source of information could be used for evil purposes such as blackmailing or kidnapping", "Many schools worldwide have proposed to include a new , mandatory course in which students learn how to grow vegetables and raise animals . Although there are some drawbacks that schools should consider , I believe this idea is generally beneficial . There are many direct and indirect advantages to learning about these topics . Firstly , children can develop an appreciation for farmers after this course . Many children , especially ones living in cities , never know where and how their vegetables and meat are produced . After knowing the amount of work and care put into making their food , they can appreciate and support local produce more . Secondly , this course can prepare them for growing vegetables at home . This skill will become important should they find themselves in a time when supplies are scarce , like during the COVID lockdown . However , that is not to say that this proposal is without disadvantages . Firstly , there is a chance that few students will ever incorporate this knowledge into their daily lives . With students living in urban areas , most will never raise livestock , while many living in apartments cannot have pets . Learning about raising livestock in detail will not be helpful for them . Secondly , this course can add more stress to students . High school kids are already under pressure to perform well in their exams , thus schools should not burden them more . Students\u2019 objection to the home economics subject is a sufficient example to illustrate this point", "In recent times , many people have started to support private companies in conducting scientific research . I argue that the results of private companies are far more innovative than government-run operations , and thus it is the former who should conduct science experiments . Firstly , I believe that government-run scientific innovation lacks any real reason to seek to improve their process , as they can always be bailed out by taxpayer money . Consequently , these programs might be less likely to discover scientific breakthroughs that can benefit the population . This can clearly be seen with many people\u2019s frustrations with NASA\u2019s recent ventures , for example , as their failed experiments led to the destruction of satellites and rockets costing billions of taxpayer\u2019s money . Meanwhile , private companies such as SpaceX continue to innovate in order to prevent wasteful expenses yet still being able to deliver success in the realm of space travel . Secondly , it might be argued that because of private companies\u2019 ability to be more efficient and effective , they can more easily apply new scientific products to the general market . The main goal of all companies is to make as much profit as possible , and therefore in theory , they always aim to make the best products that are not only scientifically innovative but high in utility as well . This is how the computer , despite having first been made by government funding , was able to enter the average household through the work of private companies such as Apple", "Nowadays , it is an observation that younger professionals prefer to work for bigger companies than for smaller businesses like the past generations . I think that there are both advantages and disadvantages to this trend for them . Working for large corporations , especially multinational ones , has various benefits . Firstly , the mere experience of working for reputable companies is already making one\u2019s resume stand out to future employers . People often think that an individual must have been extremely talented to be chosen among others to work for that large company , so they are more likely to be interested in that applicant . Another reason is that larger businesses often have a more diverse community . Employees can come from multiple backgrounds , countries , and upbringings . New employees can find it easier to develop cordial relationships with their colleagues . Networking is also easier in larger companies as people who work here are often influential and well-respected in the industry . However , there are some disadvantages that fresh graduates should consider before applying to big companies . The first one is that these companies are known for their bureaucratic systems . As a result , new employees or interns are rarely given creative space to work on their projects . In worse cases , people can find themselves unable to develop in environments like this because they are seldom assigned tasks that are contributive or vital to the projects . Another disadvantage is that working for large corporations is tiring due to low job security . These companies frequently purge their staff , which creates more pressure on employees to outperform others . Having to compete with so many other workers can take a toll on one\u2019s mental health . In conclusion , large companies\u2019 reputations will help employees in their future endeavors , while their diverse community helps employees befriend their colleagues", "Plastic containers and cutleries are becoming a ubiquitous part of the eating-out experience . However , I do think that the disadvantages of using plastic in the food and drink industries outweigh the advantages of doing so . On the one hand , using plastic is convenient for both street vendors and consumers . Most plastic containers can be discarded after a single-use , eliminating the need to wash them . Moreover , plastic does not break easily in contrast to glass containers , making them easier to carry around . Another reason is that plastic containers and cutleries are dirt cheap to produce . Because the materials needed to synthesize plastics are readily available , most plastic containers are at a lower price than their alternatives , especially in bulk . On the other hand , however , using plastics to store food can pose both a health and an environmental risk . Firstly , most plastic containers end up in the ocean , which will damage marine life . Fish can swallow these plastic cutleries , cannot digest them , and thus die . Plastic is also detrimental to landfills as they decompose relatively slowly , leading to landfill overloads . Secondly , consuming food and drinks using plastic can be harmful . Plastics are known to melt and release toxic compounds when heated , so they should not be used to store hot foods . Another concern is that some plastics contain carcinogens . This means that consumers are at a higher risk of developing cancer . In conclusion , convenience and low prices are reasons why people use plastics to store food and drinks", "There have recently been proposals to have an international language as a means of communication . In my opinion , such an endeavour is both impractical and undesirable , and in this essay I hope to explain why the potential drawbacks overshadow the advantages . There are those who believe that an international language would help to foster cross national interactions and remove barriers to economic development . By developing a common system of communication , people from different countries can better explain the culture and history of where they came from . Furthermore , by having a common language , immigration would also be easier , since there would be less difficulty in trying to integrate into a new culture . As a result , economic output might increase , as immigrants bring new talent to areas that require them . Overall , this argument suggests that a global language will mean a more unified humanity . On the other hand , I argue that an international language is impractical since languages develop organically in interaction with a country\u2019s culture and history . Thus , some words that are exclusive to certain languages would not make sense when translated into a universal system . As such , if an international language were to form , it would likely be the case that it would sooner or later fragment into dialects specific to specific regions of the world , and in the end evolve into new languages anyway . Lastly , since language is a cultural artefact , attempts at replacing all the languages in the world with one common one results in people\u2019s past stories being erased . Instead of unification , I believe that a global language would lead to less cultural diversity", "The growth of fast food companies globally , resulting in cheaper prices and greater availability , have become an increasing source of both excitement and apathy . In my opinion , this trend is in general quite harmful , since the cost to both the environment and to people is too great . A benefit of the increasing ubiquity of fast food is that those in poorer areas will be able to afford to eat . Since fast food is both cheap and quick to make , this will appeal to those with not a lot of money and time . Furthermore , fast food restaurants are also a major employer of low skilled workers , and as such , can help to provide poorer individuals with jobs . For instance , fast food chains are one of the biggest employers in countries such as America , especially in isolated towns and counties . On the other hand , it could be said that fast food does much more harm to society in the long run . Firstly , fast food has been shown to cause numerous health problems , such as increased blood pressure and risk of heart disease , which will be very costly to society . In addition , the meat necessary to uphold the supply chain of fast food restaurants requires the wholesale slaughter of animals in factory farms , which could be said to be both environmentally and morally questionable . For example , McDonalds have been shown by numerous reports to be a frequent violator of environmental legislation", "Advertising has become increasingly prominent in our daily life , leading some to ponder the\u00a0consequences . In my opinion , this development should be unwelcomed , since more specialized advertisements and more advertising jobs have come at the cost of individuals\u2019 personal privacy . On the one hand , modern advertisements are designed to be finely tuned to the viewer's browsing history , and can therefore allow customers to get more of what they want . Complex search algorithms and data collection enables advertising companies to tailor their products to suit an individual's personal tastes , allowing them to expand their profits and for the customer to spend less time browsing for products . For example , companies such as Amazon or Wish often buy data from Google in order to better advertise their products , which has allowed them to become the large corporations that they are today . Yet on the flip side , modern advertising use of personal data could be said to be a mass invasion of privacy . The smallest details about individuals\u2019 lives e . g . their sleep schedule , their locations , etc , are increasingly being collected through various mobile apps and social networks . Although terms and conditions are often shown to users before downloading or using any apps , it could be said that most people are still nonetheless unaware of the full extent to which their data is collected . It could be argued that the Cambridge Analytica scandal recently has shown many users how people\u2019s information might actually be used for socially undesirable purposes , such as influencing a result of a democratic election", "Today , only a few languages reign supreme in most countries , whilst the usage of many other languages have declined . I argue in this essay why I believe this is an unwanted trend , for although it could help stimulate economic growth , the long-term consequences of cultural erosion is comparatively more undesirable . On the one hand , it could be said that as a result of globalization , more people are learning the languages of world-leading economies , which leads to a greater overall increase in global GDP . At the moment , being bilingual boosts employment opportunities drastically for prospective employees since they can bridge the gap between two different cultures and economies . For instance , English and Chinese are the languages of choice today , and fluency is a skill sought after by international employers as they hope to do business in both English and Chinese speaking countries . However , it could be posited that language is the foundation of culture , and if people cannot communicate , they cannot form a collective identity: the result would be that the culture gets eroded over time . Going into more detail , some words in many languages cannot be translated to others precisely because they are specific to a cultural context; the decline of a language would also mean the decline of a culture . Using a more specific example , the Welsh language is barely spoken because the English sought to replace their culture following an invasion; thus , learning Welsh has been considered an important way to preserve culture for many young Welsh people", "More inexpensive methods of travelling internationally has allowed countries to open their borders to international tourists , which have led to intense debate about the merits and failings of this trend . Personally , I believe that increased global tourism has done more harm than good , for it has improved economies at the cost of cultures\u2019 individuality . On the one hand , one could argue that tourism brings in significant revenue and can thus aid economic development . Tourists when visiting other countries spend a huge amount of money on hotels , food , and shopping , thereby funding small businesses and supporting jobs . For example , the hospitality sector , particularly in locales such as the Mediterranean , brings in millions of euros a year . Tourism here serves as a vital source of revenue , and could be viewed to be hugely beneficial for job creations and public services in these areas . On the other hand , mass travel may often erode the very culture it seeks to showcase to the world . This is because the tourism companies who enter a new market might start building hotels and other services that end up pushing smaller , local businesses out of the said market , until very little of the \u201cauthentic experience\u201d remains . For instance , many cities in South East Asia , such as Sapa and Phuket , could be said to have lost their uniqueness and instead have become replicas of other tourist towns . Over time , these cities are likely to lose their charm and perhaps also their visitors", "The debate around our primary sources of energy has been intensifying in recent decades , with some pushing for more sustainable energy while others arguing that fossil fuels should remain the main source of power globally . I personally think renewable energy production should be encouraged , since it\u2019s important that nations should seek to reduce their own carbon emissions to divert the dangers of climate change as well as build a more sustainable economy . Firstly , fossil fuel should be discouraged because it could bring about the existential threat of climate change . As a result of climate change , biodiversity is at an all time low as changing climates and rising oceans , slowly erodes the delicate tapestry of food webs across the globe . As scientists are convinced this is directly the cause of human activity , such as in agriculture and fossil fuel consumption , renewable energies would help slow this threat immediately and might be our only solution to salvaging the planet . Secondly , one could argue that renewable energies are more sustainable and would therefore be better for the economy in the long run . While oils and coal are a finite resource and take millions of years to replenish , energy from wind and solar can in theory never run out . Therefore , making a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy can be a solution that thinks of the longer term , since it could avert an economic crash when oil fully depletes . Many analysts have warned that with the current trajectory , oil could run out by 2050; when this happens , it could sharply affect the biggest economies in the world that are still heavily dependent on oil", "Nowadays , there are lots of debates around whether museums should charge for admission . I think the advantages of this action far outweigh the disadvantages . Having an admission fee , no matter the price , has various benefits to the museums . This admission fee can cover most basic operating costs , such as staff wages , electricity for complex lighting systems , and security . Museums can also utilize this financial support for renovation . For example , Vietnamese museums can benefit from this renovation since most of them are old . Another advantage is that museums can use this money to enhance their performance . They can hire more curators to bring in more interesting collections , create more kids-friendly galleries , or even apply new technologies , like virtual reality or artificial intelligence . For example , many famous museums , like MoMA , provide audio tours for visitors . Science museums around the world also offer a virtual reality tour into the past . However , there are some disadvantages to charging too high for museum admission . If the admission fees are too high , this might discourage people from visiting museums . This is especially true for poor people or those who do not have a source of income , such as high school and college students or starving artists . As a result , setting admission tickets too high will defeat the purpose of a museum: to provide a source of education and entertainment to the public . Another disadvantage is that it can affect tourism because museums are usually tourist attractions . For example , Washington DC is a city that offers many free museums , although it has gift shops . These free museums are what lure tourists , especially those traveling with kids", "Nowadays , many parents , especially Asian ones , tend to educate their children to always try hard because as long as they do so , they certainly will be successful . I think there are many advantages as well disadvantages to this philosophy . It is undeniable that there are many benefits to telling children so . The first reason , obvious as it is , is that this will encourage children to become much more diligent . Self-discipline is the most difficult trait to develop for almost anyone , and telling children that success awaits them if they work hard incentivizes them to become self-disciplined . As a result , they stand a better chance of being successful since they are more goal-oriented and determined . Another reason is that these children will exhibit appreciation for hard-working people . They will perceive these people as also wanting to be successful like them and thus appreciate their diligence . Therefore , these children would be more grateful and humble towards other people . However , there are certain disadvantages to teaching children to expect success once they have worked hard . The first disadvantage is that these children can ignore other factors for success , such as natural talent , soft skills , attitude , or connections . For example , a child might be so engrossed in one's studies that one neglects to make friends , which might serve as crucial connections many years later . The second disadvantage is that children will show self-deprecating behaviors if this philosophy fails them . For example , when children study hard for their university entrance exam but cannot get into their dream school , they will blame themselves for not working hard enough . In the long run , this will be mentally exhausting for them . In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages to telling children that once they work hard , success will come", "The debate surrounding whether or not countries should import food from abroad has become increasingly prevalent , with some arguing that the trend should be kept in order to ensure the best food conditions and a healthy environment , while others believe that it would be much more economically and environmentally beneficial to consume home grown food . Personally , I agree more with the first sentiment , as there are far too many disadvantages to stopping food imports . Firstly , not all food can be grown in the same country and need to come from very specific environments , and growing food within a country\u2019s borders alone can lead to less variety . Soil conditions as well as climate and weather patterns make many of our favorite foods unable to be produced in our countries without expensive equipment to artificially imitate weather conditions where these crops are normally grown . Importing food on the other hand , helps to ensure a more varied supply of fresh local food that was grown in the environment that best suited it . An example we can observe today is the array of food products that can be seen in countries that are involved into the world trade network , for they are able to import foods from overseas . Secondly , growing our own crops may not actually be that environmentally friendly , for if demand for local crops were to increase substantially , we may be forced to fix irrigation issues and take water from natural reservoirs and nearby lakes , diverting them to our fields . The end result could call for dam projects on a massive scale that would irrevocably change ecosystems and migration patterns . Large areas of wildlife must be cleared out , for example , in order to sustain large scale chicken or cow farms . Leaving this job for areas that are more suited to agricultural production can be seen as much more efficient and environmentally friendly", "In numerous nations today , more people are living by themselves or in small units rather than living in large families like in the past . Personally , I think that this complex new development is on the whole more negative than positive , as although it can afford young people some independence , it can also create feelings of loneliness for many parts of the population . From one point of view , one could argue that living alone has also granted young people the ability to do more of what they desire . Without having to spend time taking care of their families , many young people today can instead focus on what makes them tick , socially and professionally . This in turn leads to them going into different fields from their parents , allowing them to craft their own creative projects . In developing nations such as Vietnam , for instance , many young people have been able to engage in their own start-ups , positively improving their career and the national economy . Conversely , the advent of smaller family units has helped to drive up a sense of isolation and a disconnect with one\u2019s own roots . Living alone diminishes one's primary source of social interaction , which comes from the family , possibly resulting in psychological symptoms of loneliness or even depression . This is why despite being one of the most financially independent generations , millennials today report feelings of low mood more than any other previous generations . The prioritization of work and personal ambition , hence , could come at a cost of a diminutive social life . In conclusion , I argue that while young people can be more independent living alone , this arrangement also brings with it the comparatively worse effects of a worse mental health", "In the past decades , the irregularity of the job market has forced many people to constantly alter their professions or living arrangements . Many people today are unsure of whether or not this is beneficial -\u00a0 personally , I think that the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits for society in the majority of cases , as it makes it difficult for individuals to form long-lasting relationships . On one hand , corporations increasing international connections means there is an increasing need for people to learn more languages and engage in different cultures , thereby improving global cultural awareness . Hostility between people of different backgrounds has been lower as a result of globalization , and this is almost certainly due to more intermingling as a result of national job markets shifting to be more international . Countries such as Korea , for instance , which has been isolationist for most of history , is today one of the world\u2019s biggest economies , attracting foreign workers from all over the world . As more workers change their working locations as a result of globalization , one might envision a more culturally understanding world . Yet on the other hand , the flip side of this phenomenon is the increasing difficulty of maintaining long-term relationships for most workers . Changing one\u2019s job or place of living frequently means being unable to have a strong bond with a friend group for an extended period of time . This makes it very difficult to connect with people and could lead to an overwhelming feeling of isolation spreading amongst the workforce as they are forced to prioritize their work over their friends . Relocation is difficult and could lead to severe culture shock as well , which could increase anxiety and stress . This is why the majority of employees , for example , often state job security as one of the primary motivations for them to accept any jobs", "\ufeffBusiness conferences and training are taking place more and more on online platforms , replacing the traditional face-to-face communication and information exchange . Although this trend has certain advantages , its disadvantages are much more considerable . The trend seen in companies switching their training activities and business discussions to the online mode has many advantages . First of all , this offers staff increased flexibility and full control of their timetable , which is likely to diminish the unnecessary high stress levels and thus boost their work productivity . For instance , working mothers find this incredibly helpful for them to multitask between rearing their children and joining meetings to keep abreast of developments in the company . Furthermore , this online mode of operation could help companies economize on expenditure by not having to pay for electricity bills , printed documents or equipment for carrying out the meeting or training procedures , for instance . On the other hand , this option has two major drawbacks . Firstly , communication via the internet can be a hindrance as there might be failures in the flow of information . For example , in Vietnam , not many people can afford high-speed internet connection , and as a consequence , lagging connection or computer crashing can cause disruptions , reducing the comprehension among meeting or training participants . In addition , there is little room for practice and the lack of direct guidance also prevents people from fully grasping the skills . It would be less productive because employees receiving training cannot apply what they are taught on the internet , or can be clumsy in their actual performance since there is no one to show them whether they are doing it the right way as reality is sometimes completely different from theory", "Nowadays , as many are implementing international exchange programs , people start to ponder whether this is a positive development . In my opinion , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages . International exchange programs benefit both students in the host country and those from abroad in many ways . One significant advantage is the cultural exchange between both parties . Students from abroad find themselves exposed to different cultures , while local students can learn how to introduce and promote theirs sincerely . Another benefit is that abroad students can build their independence through this program . Many abroad students live alone or stay in schools\u2019 dorms with other local students . Sometimes , this will be the first time they buy groceries , cook , or do laundry without the help of family . These experiences will shape their independence over time . However , there are some minor disadvantages to this program that many should take into consideration . At a high school level , a year of international exchange means a potential disruption in one\u2019s studies . For example , a Vietnamese curriculum differs much from an American one , which means Vietnamese students would miss out on subjects like literature when studying abroad . Moreover , a study abroad program might cause a reverse culture shock on students when they return . This phenomenon describes a person finding it difficult to adjust to one\u2019s own culture after a time in other countries . In extreme cases , usually occur when students study abroad in a developed country and return to a developing one , they can exhibit hatred for their own culture . In conclusion , I understand that the international exchange program is not exactly for any high school students due to its potential harms", "As many companies now value younger employees for their innovative mindset , many older employees find themselves rejected due to their age . I believe that this is a serious negative development with many adverse implications . Firstly , rejecting applicants based on old age alone can lead to many consequences . The most critical one being massive unemployment with many negative results . For example , when older applicants cannot find jobs , they cannot support themselves and their families . As a result , society would witness multiple financial crises . Also , this will affect future generations as their parents most likely could not afford to pay for tuition . Another consequence would be that rejecting applicants based on age would mean discrimination based on a personal element . This violation of human rights would serve as a precedent for much more unfair treatment in the workplace , such as discrimination based on gender , race , or sexual orientation . Secondly , I believe rejecting applicants based entirely on their age will eliminate many potential ones . Many industries , especially science , have tips and tricks that are not taught at schools . For example , many labs still hire old applicants because they have experience operating and fixing equipment that many fresh graduates would not be familiar with . Another reason is that older employees usually have more connections . These connections , more often than not , can help them complete tasks quicker than younger employees . For example , in the banking industry , to meet the KPI , bankers need to reach a minimum amount of money lent to businesses or individuals . Because older employees are more likely to have connections with successful business owners , they can accomplish this task better", "Many people are currently proposing a solution to solve problems in the local area: have young people do volunteer , unpaid work to help people in their neighborhood . Although there are some drawbacks to this policy , I believe it is generally beneficial to society . There are various benefits to this mandatory volunteer work . Firstly , it will help young people develop a sense of responsibility and community . By helping out people who they are familiar with growing up , they will feel more thankful and personally connected with their neighborhood . Secondly , through unpaid volunteer work , young people can significantly alleviate social problems and improve the quality of life in their community . Younger people nowadays are more open-minded and creative , which means when they channel these strengths into solving local problems , new solutions will arise . For example , many have developed group chats on social media to create an exercise-buddy program , encouraging people to do more physical activities . However , there are still some disadvantages associated with this policy . The first drawback is that this year of voluntary work will be an interruption in their studies or their work . Many students can easily forget knowledge learned after just a few months of not continuing their studies , let alone a year . The second drawback is that if this policy is mandatory , it can pose a stressor to the younger generation . For example , many already have multiple responsibilities to tend to , like taking care of their siblings , working for their families , or struggling to study or find a job . Adding yet another one will cause them to carry out the volunteer work carelessly . Some may even publicly object to it , thinking that they are stripped of their freedom . In conclusion , it is undeniable that this policy carries some disadvantages , especially for people in underdeveloped areas", "In today\u2019s modern society , the use of credit cards is ubiquitous , which led people to question whether this is a beneficial development . I think the advantages of credit cards far outweigh their disadvantages . Having a credit card guarantees many benefits for you . The first benefit is that it reduces cash usage , which means being safer and more convenient for cardholders . For example , cardholders conveniently do not have to carry around lots of cash , which means that they are at a lower risk of being robbed . Another reason why credit cards are safer than cash is that they have PINs , which discourage thefts . The second benefit is that , because each bank now has its credit card , they offer various unique features to appeal to their customers . For example , most credit cards have a cashback or reward program . This cashback can save cardholders lots of money when grocery shopping , while the reward points can sometimes be converted to free trips or hotel bookings . However , there are still some drawbacks to having credit cards , which is why many people still choose to pay by cash . The tendency to overspend is one major problem with credit cardholders . Because credit cards allow users to spend more than the amount in their account balance , many users indulge in their spending , thus incur debts when they cannot pay back by the end of the month . Another problem is that credit cards are often targets for scams . Many people carelessly share information that might be answers to their security questions , like their relatives\u2019 names , or the model of their first car , which makes scammers\u2019 jobs easier . Another mistake when using credit cards is to take pictures of your credit card number , along with the PIN , since it is easy to hack into your phone to retrieve this information", "With the advancement of technology , humans use robots more than ever , both at home and work . Although some challenges need to be addressed , I think this development is mostly beneficial . There are various benefits to having robots helping out with chores and professional tasks . The first advantage is that now people will have more time to spend on other aspects of life . For example , mothers no longer have to spend time cooking and cleaning , so they can take better care of their children and themselves . Another advantage is that by utilizing robots , humankind can achieve more remarkable feats in science and technology . Because robots complete repetitive tasks quicker and more accurately , incorporating robots into the workforce will result in higher productivity . As a result , clothing , pre-packaged food , or technological devices will be available to humans at a cheaper cost . Nevertheless , the massive use of robots will guarantee serious consequences . The most obvious one is a global loss of jobs , as robots are taking away positions occupied by humans . For example , with the automation of production lines , many factory workers will find themselves without a job and any qualifications or skills to apply for another . As a result , governments will face a wave of unemployment , potentially leading to financial crises . Another consequence is that the dependency on robots will cause a lack of survival skills . For example , if robots do all the chores for people , future generations will lack necessary skills like cooking , doing laundry , or cleaning houses . This lack of skills means humans in the future will become less self-sufficient , which can be dangerous . In conclusion , although I have to admit that heavy dependence on robots has certain serious implications , moderate use of robots to help with chores and repetitive tasks at work generally is beneficial", "In the present day , an increase in the number of package tours to distant destinations such as mountainous areas mark a new tendency of the tourist industry . Although this development is beneficial to the local residents in terms of economy and living conditions , it can have deleterious effects on the environment and the social security of these areas . On the one hand , increasing package holidays to remote areas is closely associated with the growth of the economy . For one thing , this new trend in tourism can create more employment in the local areas as the job market for tourist-related services frequently needs human resources . This in turn provides a stable income for local dwellers . What is more , such development in employment rates could be equal to the increase in income tax contributions to the budget of local governments . As a result , local authorities can help raise the living standards of people , starting by having important infrastructure established like the installation of water pipes or construction of hospitals . On the other hand , the development of package tours to remote areas may act as a detriment to the local environment as well as public security . Firstly , the construction of tourism facilities like hotels can drastically change the landscape of one area , meaning the loss of habitat for local species . Also , massive hordes of tourists scramming to these remote communities may lead to a serious risk of security as the tourists can have disrespectful behavior toward the customs of local people or involve themselves in criminal acts like illegal trafficking", "Much edible food is lost or wasted in many nations . While several factors contribute to this issue , it is still manageable with some creative problem-solving . The leading causes of food waste are inadequate planning on the side of consumers and excessive food preparation in the service industry . Occasionally , individuals must thoroughly anticipate when and how it will be consumed to purchase large quantities of food . As a result of their busy job and appointment schedules , individuals often adjust their meal preparation plans or neglect to utilize food on time . Secondly , most restaurants , hotels , and the food service business tend to create excess food . While the intention is commendable , particularly in anticipation of many customers and to avoid running out of available food , over-preparation often causes food waste if all the food is unsold . There are some viable options available to remedy this situation . In order to reduce food waste , it is essential to maintain a balance between food supply and demand . Risk management systems using AI predictions should be used in hotels , restaurants , and the food service industry to identify the optimal amount of food to prepare . The second strategy should emphasize creating technologies and production systems that enhance storage , harvesting , processing , and distribution . Redistribution may be the principal strategy for providing or allocating more food to regions with a need and reducing the food supply in regions with an overabundance . In conclusion , food waste is increasing due to insufficient planning on the part of customers and unnecessary food preparation in the service industry", "The rapid speed of advancement in human lives has led us to the dilemma of maintaining the equilibrium between working and living . This essay would delve into the reason why many people encounter the failure of balancing those aforementioned aspects and propose certain solutions to deal with the problem . The unattainable goals of stabilizing work and life can be attributed to financial and social pressure as well as household responsibilities that one has to fulfill . Chief among these is that people are working in a goal-oriented way to make ends meet which imposes tremendous strain that they have to suffer . This can be explained by the fear of being heavily in debt or not having a decent life in the future once they stop working . Also , social recognition has created a burden that most individuals have to shoulder . Working arduously and continuously to climb to a higher position on the career ladder has been the ultimate goal of employees due to their obsession with acknowledgment from society . Concerning the second reason , a myriad of domestic duties such as taking care of children and parents has led to the insufficient amount of time allocated for individuals themselves . The shortage of time for relaxation and recharging energy has contributed to the impossibility of balancing work and life for most people . Fortunately , the efficient working approach and the sharing of household responsibilities can be applied to address those problems . With regard to the former , people should modify their working style , from laboriously to efficiently and productively by means of multitasking . For example , waiting time in commuting by public transport can be used to check emails , plan personal schedules or revise reports . Turning to the second idea , family members are encouraged to share household chores with each other to lighten the burden that one has to carry . In this way , everyone would have more time to cater to their favorite pastimes such as watching a movie or journaling after working hours . In conclusion , people cannot achieve the goal of balancing working and living due to the pressure of maintaining a stable financial state as well as projecting a positive image to meet the requirements of society", "\ufeffIncreased industrialization has led to the proliferation of young people moving from the countryside to cities . However , the growth of cities has created many social problems . In this essay , I will highlight some of these problems as well as ways to combat them . The increasing rates of suicide and homelessness could be the main problems of social rapid development . It is true that higher rates of suicide have gone hand in hand with the rise of cities . This is because of the extreme amount of stress originating in harsh competition in working environments that exists within cities . Another common issue with cities is homelessness . The more people move to the cities , the more unaffordable prices of houses in the central area become . This leads to a high concentration of homeless within cities such as London or New York . Also , as automation increases within cities , it is likely that there will be a higher rate of unemployment . Hence , the problem of homelessness will likely persist . Possible solutions to solving these problems may include the provision of access to more mental health services and the relocation of industrial zones to the suburbs . Chief among these is that more funds should be allocated to the healthcare system or passing legislation that would make it mandatory for companies and schools to provide assistance to those with psychological problems . Regarding the latter solutions , urgent actions should be taken to move major industries to the outskirts , which consequently prevents people from migrating to cities and hence lower the homelessness rate in metropolises . In conclusion , there have been many problems that have been associated with the rise of cities , such as higher suicide rates and homelessness", "An ample amount of money tends to be invested in special celebrations , namely weddings . This essay will first explain the reasons for this tendency , and secondly , think that it is a negative development . There are many reasons for this development , two of which are the purposes of showing off people's wealth and enhancing their social standing . The first factor behind it refers to the desperate need to boast about one's opulence , from which some individuals\u2019 pleasure is deprived . The practice can be explained by the pride people may take when others express great admiration towards their exclusive possessions which are allocated for organizing luxurious weddings . Another point worth mentioning is that these days , the social standing of a family tends to depend on the way they organize their children\u2019s weddings . If the celebration is grand and splendid , their position on a social scale would be greatly promoted . Consequently , there would be an increasing number of families attempting to set up weddings that are as magnificent as possible . In my opinion , expensive weddings are negative for several reasons related to unnecessary competition in extravagant spending , and wastage of resources . Chief among these is that many families would enter into rivalry with one another to show their affluence , which forces them to spend immoderate amounts of money on such sumptuous celebrations . The worst consequence to be considered is that those people could live in an era of indebtedness . The second issue worth exploring is that tremendous resources such as food and clothes would be wasted . For example , after weddings are organized in a restaurant , it is usually reported that a great number of leftovers would be thrown away as it is impossible for them to serve the purpose of reusing . In conclusion , I understand the tendency of setting up bigger and more costly weddings partly as a means of showing one\u2019s wealth and partly as an approach to upgrade their social status", "In comparison to people in former times , who had a tendency to settle down in one location , those in nowadays society can reside in several destinations . This essay will first explain the reasons for this development , and secondly , think that it is a positive development . This trend can be attributed to certain reasons , two of which are the proliferation of employment opportunities and advancement in means of transportation . The first factor behind it refers to the widespread availability of jobs in myriad fields in different places , which encourages migration to ensure the livelihood and the growth of career prospects . Thus , individuals have no hesitation in making relocations at frequent occurrences . The second , and also the possible explanation is that improvement in transportation , including the wide range of vehicles such as airplanes , subways , and electric buses , has beneficially facilitated traveling at ease . It is true that people would find no difficulty in moving from one place to another with affordable prices and in a short amount of time . In my opinion , this development is positive for several reasons related to chances to accumulate profound knowledge and the eradication of prejudice among different ethnic groups . Chief among these is the regular change in one\u2019s residential address plays a crucial role in maximizing exposure to other cultures and customs . Consequently , there is a high possibility that this practice would enhance one's mentality and broaden his or her horizon as well . On a societal level , thanks to the authentic experience of others\u2019 lifestyles , the bias people may show when confronting exotic people would probably be eliminated . For example , people who enjoyed life in Africa would be more tolerant and empathetic to the black because of the understanding of their suffering derived from harsh living conditions . To summarise , the practice of frequent change in accommodation these days can be ascribed to the diversity in the job market and development in transportation", "These days , an increasing number of people have chosen to become parents later in their lives . A few explanations for this trend could be offered , as well as its positive and negative effects on society . First of all , the trend of delayed parenthood could be attributed to two main reasons . To start with , people are attaching more weight to their professional lives rather than their personal ones . A considerable number of young adults nowadays spend the first years of their adulthood to lay a concrete foundation for their career and only start building a family once they have achieved certain professional milestones . Furthermore , many people are of the opinion that children are better raised in families with sound financial statuses . Such a family can mostly be found among older couples , who have spent years working and accumulating their wealth . As to the impacts of delayed parenthood on society , I strongly believe that neither its advantages or disadvantages can outweigh the other . On the one hand , having older parents can bring many benefits for a child . Since the couple will probably have had a stable financial background , the child will likely to have proper education with less worries about loans and debts . Another advantage is that aged parents are more knowledgeable , meaning that the child can be reprimanded appropriately from their upbringings , which is a positive sign for an upright citizen . On the other hand , older mothers are more prone to grave health risks during pregnancy and their children are more exposed to innate diseases . It has been proven that women having kids after the age of thirty can be dangerous for both themselves and the babies , which is why this decision is not recommended by health staff . By and large , people choose to bear children at older ages due to their high regards for their careers and the belief that a better financial state will be better for a child", "Nowadays , more and more youngsters avoid working in the agricultural sector . This trend can stem from several causes that will be discussed in this essay , along with a number of reasons why there should be more young farmers . There are two reasons why young adults shy away from farming work . First , the prosperity of new and more lucrative occupations leads to people favoring these posts . Compared to other sectors , agriculture around the world does not have a high income and oftentimes , this earning is unstable as it depends heavily on the yield of the crops . Another possible cause for this trend is universal education , which leads to more young people thinking that being farmers is not high-class enough for an educated person . They tend to gravitate towards jobs that are perceived as smart and classy , such as white-collar professions , since lives on the farm are usually painted as modest and dull . Despite the aforementioned reasons , young adults should be incentivized to become farmers . First , farming has been and will always be one of the most important sectors of society , that is why a shortage in personnel could lead to worldwide crisis . Food being one of the fundamentals of life means that its supply process should be well-oiled in order to sustain people\u2019s well-being . This can only be achieved if there is a sufficient supply of manpower to carry out the production . Moreover , young minds can help drive improvements in this ancient profession . As youngsters are more adaptive to new technologies , they can apply these to their farms and as a result , produce healthier food . To conclude , young people nowadays are likely to avoid working on farms due to the expansion of alternative professions and universal education", "A growing number of individuals have started taking up a healthy diet and regular exercising , which could have positive effects on their overall well-being . In this essay , I will discuss some possible causes , as well as methods that can be adopted to encourage this trend . There are two reasons behind people\u2019s increasing preference towards working out and a balanced diet . First of all , individuals nowadays are more educated about the connection of their lifestyle with their well-being . Information is abundant and people can get all kinds of knowledge instantly , including the impacts of nutrient intake and physical activities on their bodies . Consequently , habits which can contribute to a healthier life have gained considerable popularity . Secondly , living conditions have improved , thus , individuals are more likely to spend on matters that are of secondary importance like looks . It is a fact that a nutritious diet is more costly than fast foods , therefore , only people who are beyond the threshold of livelihood can spend their money on bettering their lifestyles . As consuming healthy foods and exercising are beneficial to individuals\u2019 well-being , a plethora of methods can be employed to incentivize people\u2019s commitment to this trend . First , making physical activities mandatory in a school and an office setting can help convert sedentary people into more active individuals . No matter how long the exercise is , as long as it gets individuals up and working out , over time , they will form the habit of doing physical activities . Moreover , the government should offer free exercising facilities , such as communal gyms to all citizens to encourage less fortunate people to participate . Last but not least , decreasing tax on healthy foods can support people\u2019s intake of these kinds of foodstuff , instead of veering to unhealthy choices , such as fast food . All in all , the improved living conditions and easy access to information are the causes behind the increased interest in healthy lifestyles", "There have been increasing concerns over the negative effects of the growth in consumer goods production to the environment . While this problem can be attributed to a number of causes , many solutions can be proposed to alleviate the adverse impacts . To start with , the increase in consumer goods production stems from two key reasons . First , it is accelerated by the spread of consumerism . Businesses are fond of this trend as it can help them generate a fortune . However , what the buying culture actually causes is people\u2019s intensifying demands for new innovations and depreciation of their existing assets . Consequently , products which are still usable are discarded rather than recycled , increasing the amount of trash . Moreover , people\u2019s lack of awareness on the impacts of contemporary products to nature is another major cause . Some clueless consumers are over-optimistic , thinking that the clothing item they just dumped will be reused , without thinking about the underlying costs such as energy and harmful fuels coming from the recycling process or the production of their new garments . Nevertheless , effective measures can be taken to minimize consumer goods\u2019 adverse effects on the environment . First , businesses should opt for environmentally-friendly materials . This is both fashionable for the company as educated buyers nowadays prefer eco-friendly products made from natural materials like bamboo , and help the business to reduce their carbon footprint . Furthermore , an extra tax could be levied on companies which use fossil fuels , and a monetary incentive could be provided for businesses to switch to renewable energy sources . For example , Lego has announced that their first carbon neutral plant will be constructed in Vietnam . Aside from other appeals , the Vietnamese government has strong support for renewable energy development , with generous economic incentives like tax exemptions . By and large , consumerism and people\u2019s lack of awareness are the root causes of the acceleration in consumer goods production", "The increasing amount of food waste the world over has become a grave problem that needs to be addressed urgently . While there are a host of reasons contributing to this issue , I believe that there are a great number of feasible solutions to tackle it . The growing amount of discarded food can be ascribed to the devaluation of food items , which roots from the improving living standards . Nowadays , food is not a rarity but rather something that exists in abundance in many countries , especially in developed ones . The proliferation of consumerism has led to a surplus of foodstuffs , which means that people do not see it as a survival necessity but as a form of entertainment . Old money and new money alike buy food without thinking about its use and their food consumption rate , and as a result , products that are not eaten must be discarded . To address this problem , definite actions need to be taken . To start with , governments should raise consumer\u2019s awareness on conscious consumption of food items . Citizens should be taught how not to overbuy and overconsume , and instead reuse leftovers or portion their meals accordingly . This could be aided by the use of educational television programs or community campaigns hosted by local authorities and institutions . Secondly , implementing a fine for households which discard food more than the average dumping rate . What the government can do is to introduce a reasonable quota of food waste that each individual can discharge and levy a tax on those who exceed their quota . The accumulated fine can be used to process garbage food", "There has been an increase in the unemployment rate among the young in various countries , which has stirred up great concerns . This essay will discuss the problems as well as possible solutions for this issue . As a matter of fact , the rise in youth unemployment is going to negatively affect a country in many aspects . First , the short-term and long-term effect on the national economy is inevitable . The fact that the most potent generation cannot contribute would be an immediate loss . Meanwhile , an aging workforce is going to be an imminent problem with insufficient supply of young power . From an individual perspective , one who fails to find a job may suffer from stress stemming from family and peer pressure . In extreme cases , this can even lead to depression and deaths . Examples have been set in Japan , where a small proportion of jobless young adults , called hikikomori , refuse communication with the outside world and have to rely on their families or social assistance . In order to address the issue , various strategies can be adopted . Firstly , to increase the rate of employment , one has to be trained or educated properly . Many countries , especially in Africa , need to raise their citizen\u2019s awareness of the importance of education so as to decrease the school dropout rate . Secondly , governments should subsidize vocational training programs for youngsters to enhance their skill sets . Moreover , from an individual point of view , parental support is crucial in guiding the young generation on correct career paths . It has been proven that students who receive mental guidance and support from their parents stand a higher chance in success later in life . In conclusion , high youth unemployment is going to have detrimental effects on the economy and social situation of a country", "The 21st century has witnessed the growth of universal education , yet many are suffering from illiteracy . This essay will discuss the disadvantages as well as how this grave issue can be tackled . As a matter of course , not being able to read or write will limit one\u2019s accessibility to general knowledge . Nowadays , written sources of information still account for the majority of knowledge . Take signposts , for example , the best option on the road for a driver to rely on to locate his whereabouts are road signs . However , with these being written signs , people who are unable to read have to find counterintuitive alternatives to look for directions . Moreover , illiteracy can put one at a great disadvantage at work where written messages play a crucial role in day-to-day communication . What most white-collar positions require these days is the ability to perform basic office tasks such as typing . This means that illiterate people would not be qualified for any of these jobs , and consequently , are tied to blue-collar , low-paid posts . Nevertheless , there are a number of solutions that can be applied to alleviate this issue . First , ensuring universal education will play a significant role in the fight against illiteracy . Basic classes that teach reading and writing should be openly accessible for citizens of all ages , especially the disadvantaged or ethnic minority groups . Furthermore , infrastructure concerning education such as schools and roads needs to be constructed and improved in a way that people in all places can gain access to educational institutions easily . In Vietnam , many ethnic children have lost their right to learn due to poor road conditions; therefore , infrastructure should be one of the first areas that need fixing . The lack of fundamental skills such as reading or writing certainly results in major setbacks in one\u2019s knowledge and career path", "Nowadays , people have the tendency to migrate to cosmopolitan cities . While this has caused several problems to young people , namely a lack of housing and high cost of living , I believe that there are a number of feasible solutions to these issues . To begin with , the rapid population growth in major cities has led to two serious problems for youngsters . First , the young populace has to face a housing crisis . The speed at which people migrate is faster than the speed at which cities can build infrastructure . Therefore , once the number of dwellers rise exponentially , housing is bound to run out , causing many to resort to areas with lower living standards . Take Hong Kong for example , due to a lack of land , house prices in Hong Kong can reach almost 2 , 000 US dollars per square foot . This has driven many people to move into flats which can fit only a bed . Another issue is that the cost of living in these cosmopolitan cities tend to be more costly as compared to rural areas . For example , in America , the living cost in Atlanta is only a half of that in New York . Problematic as it is , I believe that there are two possible solutions to the above mentioned issues . First of all , the government should relocate businesses to the city outskirts and other provinces . By doing this , more land area can be liberated for housing purposes . Moreover , as job opportunities are spread evenly throughout the country , a city would not have to face a surge of migrants . Secondly , a price stabilization policy should be implemented for basic necessities . This is to ensure that private businesses have to operate according to the fixed price bracket of the law , thus guaranteeing that city dwellers will always have access to food , water and electricity , and gasoline at a reasonable price . To sum up , the trend of migration to major cities has two setbacks for young people , which are the lack of housing and high living cost", "With the advancement of healthcare and social welfare , people now live longer than in the past . This phenomenon would cause some adverse effects on both individuals and society . Fortunately , there are some ways to tackle this problem . The longer life span detrimentally affects individuals\u2019 mental and physical health and causes stagnation in our society . From an individual perspective , the longer people live , the weaker they become . The degradation in health results in a plethora of diseases that older people have to painfully withstand . Not to mention that the inability to continue working for the elderly makes them feel left out or redundant . As a consequence , there are high chances that they are prone to negative feelings , thereby adversely affecting their mental health . On a societal level , stagnation on a national scale is an ultimate issue caused by having too many old people . A great proportion of governmental fund and social welfare would be allocated to health care which most elderly requires . Thus , there would be an imbalance in investment in other sectors , namely education or transportation , which play a pivotal role in developing the country . Fortunately , the government and businesses can and have carried multiple solutions to lessen the effects of this issue . The first measure is gradually lifting the retirement age . The government is implementing this solution by increasing the retirement age by a few months every year . This would ensure that people can still be a contributor to society when they reach their old age . A second solution is to offer fitness facilities that would encourage the elderly to do regular physical exercises . As a result , they would find their own happiness in their later years of life . In addition , once old people have good health , the demand for health care and social welfare would significantly reduce . In conclusion , having a large percentage of old people is causing pressure on those individuals and society", "That there has been a devastating decline of the number of animals and plants the world over has become an alarming fact . Although there are many reasons for this phenomenon , there are also feasible solutions . There are two reasons behind this decline . The first of which is deforestation . Nowadays , deforestation is an alarming problem throughout the world . Trees are cut down to clear space for cow grazing , farming , and wood harvesting . This leads to a direct loss of natural habitat for wildlife and exposes flora and fauna to the risk of extinction . According to recent estimates of the World Animal Foundation , around 137 species of flora and fauna are lost to deforestation per day . Another reason worth mentioning is climate change . Due to the greenhouse effect , the world\u2019s temperature has been rising non-stop , which culminates in the increasing frequency of wildfires that are life threatening to both plants and animals . For instance , in 2020 , Brazil\u2019s wildfires wiped out an estimated number of 17 million animals . While this phenomenon is catastrophic , there are a number of feasible solutions to tackle this problem . First , governments should implement stricter policies regarding commercial logging . Heavier fines should be levied on illegal loggers and forest ranger forces should have more reinforcements . Such tough measures will discourage illegal timber harvesting operations to a degree . Another solution is to encourage large companies to cut down on their carbon footprint . Corporations the world over can switch to eco-friendly energy sources and materials . For example , LEGO is currently building a carbon neutral plant in Binh Duong Province in Vietnam in an effort to minimize its carbon emissions . In conclusion , the increasing disappearance of wildlife and plants can be attributed to climate change and deforestation", "Museums and other venues of cultural significance have been disappointed in their surprising lack of visits from the local population , instead having most visitors coming from abroad . In this essay , I will outline why I believe the lack of interest from local populations arises from the fact that they are already part of the culture and thus do not feel the need to discover it . In order to remedy this , I argue that museums should constantly change their exhibitions to uphold variety and pull in more domestic visitors . I believe that it is almost counter-intuitive that the local populace , who have been affected the most by cultural and historical sites in their town , have the least interest . It may merely be the case that the reason why foreign tourists are the main visitors is because they come to experience local sites and cultures for the first time , and as such are more attracted to these places of cultural and historical significance due to their novelty . This is why many Parisians do not visit the Eiffel Tower , for example , because they already see it every day , and spending money to explore it is simply a waste . Thus , I argue that in order to attract the local populace , most museums should use a system of special exhibits that are replaced after a few months . This instills a sense of urgency as the exhibit is only available for a limited time , which may foster the interest of the local populace . The Modern Art Museum in London regularly hosts various exhibitions , for instance , attracting millions of visitors from London every year . This way , locals might find it more worthwhile to explore local museums , since there is something new to see every time", "It is a rare sight nowadays to see people in big cities , especially young ones , exercising routinely . I think that there are two main reasons for this phenomenon . The first reason is that people are under too much stress from their jobs and their social life . Many office workers are asked or expected to not leave the workplace until they meet their deliverables , which means they are working overtime almost every day . As a consequence , they have little time left to take care of themselves . Usually , most people would use this free time to do house chores , take care of their family , or go out with friends . When asked , many young professionals would answer that the reason why they do not exercise is that they do not have the time to commit to the activity . The second reason why people in urban areas do not exercise regularly is that they do not have the financial means to afford a gym membership or a personal trainer . It is a fact that the gym industry is growing and so is the popularity of having a personal trainer . People coming from an underprivileged background would not spend their money at gyms , thinking that it would be a waste . Instead , they opt for cheaper or even free options of exercising , like walking . However , these people usually cannot commit to their routine as they do not have to invest much in it", "It is a fact that nowadays , rarely any young people can be seen listening to or performing classical music . I think there are two main reasons for this phenomenon . Although I think children should be introduced to classical music , I still think young people should be encouraged to listen to or perform the genre of music they want . There are two main reasons why young people are not interested in classical music . The first reason is there are a lot of other widely available genres . For example , the K-pop wave is unbeatable in Vietnam , with almost all teenagers having listened to this genre at least once . Classical music is not as widely appreciated , often called \"music for people with taste\u201d . This discourages young people from learning more about classical music as it distances itself from the general public . Another reason is that people cannot relate themselves to classical music due to it having no lyrics and there is little interaction between the artists and the audience . As a result , the artist distances himself or herself from the audience , which is why people find it hard to be fans of classical music , but they readily become K-pop fans . However , I do think that classical music should still be introduced to teenagers . The first reason is that , for those who have a heightened sense of music , classical music is a way for them to discover whether or not they are interested in a music career . Also , classical music has been proven to aid in learning things . However , I do not think that teenagers should be encouraged to listen to classical music . I think that people should be encouraged to explore multiple genres of music , but at the end of the day , people's preferences and art should not be encouraged or be guided . In conclusion , I think that there are two main reasons why young people do not listen to or perform classical music", "It is a recurring theme in Generation Z that more of us are avoiding talking to older people , even if they are family members . Differences in viewpoints and means of communication often cause this problem . However , there are actions that both older and younger generations can take to improve this situation . There is , without a shadow of a doubt , a generational gap in the way people think about social issues . Older people think of social problems that younger generations deemed progressive to be irrational . For example , gender equality is something many teens and young adults have difficulties explaining to their parents , even to the most basic concepts , like why both men and women should contribute to chores . There is also a difference in preferred means of communication . For example , most older people prefer to talk face to face or at least through the telephone . Younger people , on the other hand , prefer to text . Moreover , younger people text in slang and use multiple stickers and emojis to convey their thoughts , which are novel concepts to older people . However , there are still ways to connect older generations to their younger ones . On the younger generation side , they should feel responsible to spend more time with older people , especially their parents and grandparents . By doing activities like learning about family history or talking about how lives in the past were , younger people can appreciate what older people have gone through . Older people can also connect with their younger peers by updating themselves with current social movements or means of communication . For example , they can read news channels that target young adults or familiarize themselves with social media . Through these actions , they show to their kids or grandchildren that they do care about them and do not automatically dismiss liberal ideas", "As technology continues to advance rapidly , many elderly people are finding it difficult to catch up . In my opinion , this is a result of a lack of exposure to electronic devices and education on the theory behind new technologies , which can both be remedied by free workshops for older people . Firstly , it might be the case that elderly people do not have a need for electronic devices . Since they have lived most of their lives using older technologies , they might still resort to less advanced ways of doing things in order to get by . As a result , elderly people might be less exposed to incrementally more advanced technology every year , as opposed to age groups such as Gen Z , who have grown up alongside the outburst of new devices and the internet . Thus , I believe that since a lack of awareness about both the purpose and ins and outs of new technology , government programs in the form of classes and workshops could be used to help familiarise old people with these technologies . This might be able to take the form of theory classes as well as hand on engagement with devices . This has been tried and tested in many countries such as the UK , and have shown great success at improving elderly technological literacy", "Nowadays , with the prevalence of restaurants and food shops , many people are concerned that food waste from these businesses is becoming a problem . Although there are legitimate reasons for the problem , there are also solutions to it . The most common reason why restaurants throw away food at the end of the day is overestimating the number of their customers . Restaurants are not entirely to blame for this since customer flow varies from day to day and depends on multiple factors , such as traffic or weather . For example , on rainy days , restaurants can expect a significant reduction in the number of customers . Another cause of food waste in food businesses is to avoid lawsuits for food poisoning . If a restaurant reuses its ingredients for the next day\u2019s food , it runs a risk of food poisoning , which usually ends up either in a bad review or a lawsuit against the business . For example , many franchise bakeries have their employees throwing away any baked goods that did not make the sale at the end of the day . However , fortunately , there are some solutions to prevent or lessen the effects of this problem . The first solution , already used by multiple restaurants , is to donate the extra food . Homeless shelters , orphanages , or even the employees themselves would greatly appreciate the food . Many restaurants in rural areas even feed the waste veggies to their farmed animals , like cows and pigs . However , to prevent food waste from happening in the first place , restaurants need to avoid over-preparing food . Large-scale restaurants can afford to survey how their customer flow fluctuates with different factors to predict how many portions they should make each day . Businesses can also design better menus to minimize potential food waste . For example , menus that have multiple dishes that share common ingredients can reduce material waste", "In the last decade , there has been a significant rise in the number of plagiarism cases reported . I believe that both a lack of interest and poor time management skills can explain this phenomenon , but there are also solutions to tackle this . Among various reasons for this dishonesty in writing-intensive courses , one that stands out is the lack of interest in the course . Many students are forced to take the class to fulfill some requirements for graduation , which is why they think they can spend time doing something else . As a result , they often plagiarise because they did not learn anything in class . However , many students with good academic performance also plagiarise simply because their time management skills are inefficient . For example , many overachieving students aim for multiple goals at once , meaning they do not have enough time to tend to each one . This lack of time explains why they tend to plagiarise to save time writing essays . Regardless of the reasons , plagiarism can be tackled through various methods . Firstly , professors can check in with students more often during the writing process . This method is most often used in college education to ensure that students do not have problems in their writing process . This method lowers the chance of plagiarism since students will have to discuss their papers with teachers beforehand . Secondly , many schools also offer peer-review sessions before submitting papers . These sessions are for fellow students to read each other\u2019s works and check whether they might run a risk of plagiarising . Many professors even give out bonus points for those who detect signs of dishonesty . In conclusion , I believe that the increasing rate of plagiarism in education mainly stems from a lack of interest in the course , along with poor time management skills", "Currently , with the widespread popularity of TV shows centered around crimes , people start to wonder about the reason for its popularity and the effects it has on society . I think the element of suspense plays a significant role in this success , and generally , it has positive effects . There are many reasons why people enjoy this genre of entertainment . Many people find the element of suspense presented in these TV shows interesting . Crime TV shows are usually of the thriller genre , which means the audience can pick up various clues and hints from the characters , plots , or settings . As the crime unfolds , the show stimulates and challenges the audience to think critically . As a result , most people will experience a rush of adrenaline watching these shows . Another reason is that police work and criminal investigation are normally obscured from the public eyes due to the nature of the field . As a result , when TV shows portray these lines of work , the audience always wants to know more . Regardless of why people are into crime TV shows , these genres generally do have positive aspects to them . The first effect is that it trains people\u2019s observational and critical thinking skills . For example , by watching how detectives investigate crimes , people can learn how to set up a hypothesis and logically prove the theory . Another positive effect of watching crime TV shows is that it portrays a more positive picture of police and law enforcement . Many crime TV shows , like CSI , have inspired people to become forensics technicians . This effect is crucial because this is a field of work that , while interesting and honorable , is tremendously understaffed and underappreciated . In conclusion , the element of suspense and the chance to learn about crime investigation are why many are fans of crime TV shows", "The consumption of sugar-based drinks by the world\u2019s population appears to be proliferating . In my opinion , this has been a result of the production process in making these drinks becoming ever more efficient , and in order to stop them from being increasingly sold , the government should apply a sugar-tax meant to dissuade producers from putting sugar in their drinks . Firstly , I believe that mass production techniques have lowered the costs of producing soft drinks which are then sold abroad . As more products are made using machinery , the marginal cost of creating them goes down . This results in a glut of products that cannot be absorbed by a domestic market alone , and is thus shipped worldwide in order to increase profits . This is why companies such as Coca Cola and Pepsi can be seen all over the world today . Nonetheless , I argue that government intervention in the form of a supply-side sugar tax might be the solution . Instead of having customers bear the cost of a higher tax , producers should be charged if they use sugar in their products . This in turn forces these companies to create products that are healthier . In the UK , for example , a sugar tax has been shown to be effective at reducing the sugar consumption across the country . In conclusion , I argue that mass production mechanisms have allowed soft drinks companies to expand their markets and allow more people to use their products", "In today\u2019s modern society , single-use products are still a common sight . Although they carry with them many problems , both in terms of seriousness and variety , both businesses and governments can take actions to eliminate them . Because most disposable products derive from plastic , they pose a considerable threat . Firstly , the production of these products will eventually lead to a depletion of natural resources . The majority of plastics are now made from natural gas or compounds related to the oil industry , which are both materials that are becoming more scarce . Secondly , the mass disposal of single-used products leads to an accumulation of waste and a pollution problem . Because plastic products are non-biodegradable , when disposed to the oceans , marine animals , like fish , can swallow them and die . Plastics can also cause soil and underground water contamination through leaking microbeads to these environments . Luckily , these harmful effects can be prevented by efforts made by both governments and businesses . Firstly , enterprises that consume lots of single-use products , like restaurants or supermarkets , can promote behaviors that reduce this usage . For example , some supermarkets in Ho Chi Minh City are now charging extra when customers do not bring their shopping bags . Some coffee shops and restaurants can also give out reward points when customers use their own bottles or utensils . Secondly , governments can take steps to entirely ban the use of single-use products . For example , they can start by taxing heavily on these items . Other effective actions include placing a fine when people excessively use these types of products . In conclusion , the excessive use of single-use products has many adverse effects on the environment , both in terms of resource depletion and pollution", "In recent years , many observations have shown a negative development that people are communicating less with their neighbors . There are various causes to this phenomenon , and luckily , there are also feasible solutions . \ufeffThe hustle and bustle of modern societies is the main reason for this phenomenon . More people reported being busier than ever at work and school . Because they have less time to spare , they would choose to dedicate this free time to building connections , taking care of themselves and their families , or learning another skill . As a result , they spend less time with their neighbors . Another reason is that people are becoming more reserved . People value their privacy more than they do in the last decade , which is why they tend to keep to themselves more . For example , many young adults living in apartment buildings admit to not conversing with neighbors for fear of being scrutinized or talked about . However , there are ways to bring communities together . The first solution is simply to host more community events on holidays . For example , a neighborhood can hold decorating or cooking events and traditional games to celebrate Tet or Christmas . Another solution is to create group chats on social media platforms to communicate . So far , this solution has proven to be successful for most apartment communities . Because the younger generation spends more time on social media , it is easier to converse there . Many people cannot spend time talking face-to-face , but they are more willing to share about raising kids , buying groceries , hobbies , work , or even problems in that neighborhood online . In conclusion , being more occupied with work or school and being more reserved is why people hesitate to connect with their community", "The nature of labor in our modern world is changing at a fundamental level , with many workers worried that they will not be able to maintain their job conditions for long periods of time . Personally I think this is the result of stagnating wages and the advances of automation , and can only be resolved with a universal basic income for the whole population . Firstly , I argue that society is witnessing the worst wage stagnation in generations , which is causing people to constantly look for better paying jobs . As cost increases yet wages not following suit , most of the workforce have to scramble to reach for managerial positions or risk losing their disposable incomes . This in turn creates a situation where many people have to take up multiple jobs in order to make ends meet . In the US and UK , for instance , it is estimated that millions of workers are on zero-hour contracts , which does not guarantee a set number of hours of work . Secondly , as corporations seek to reduce expenditure as much as possible , they aim to replace the workforce with machines , leading to higher levels of unemployment and less stable job conditions . As machines encroach on the workforce , jobs become focused on the maintenance of the robots running our factories , and therefore there is higher competition for the dwindling number of jobs with gradually raising entry barriers . The end result is sure to be tension amongst socio-economic classes that can afford entry into the workforce if the effect of automation is not being mitigated . I argue that in order to solve this , it is important to implement Universal Basic Income , which is an equal lump sum of money given to all citizens of countries every month or year . This would help people to keep their jobs and not have to take up precarious work , since they have enough money to buy basic necessities . This scheme can already be seen in Canada during the COVID 19 outbreak , for example , with citizens getting 2000 Canadian dollars a year . This has been hugely popular , as it allowed Canadians to have some level of stability even as the economy came to a halt", "Many people have recently taken notice that environmental erosion has been coupled with the proliferation in the production of consumer products . I believe a large number of the environmental issues today are the direct effect of overpopulation , hence the requirement for government intervention in the form of sex education . A factor behind the increased consumption of consumer products is a booming global population . As a population grows , more natural resources are needed towards housing and infrastructure projects; this leads to environmental degradation as forests are chopped down and fossil fuel burnt in order to cater to the needs of extra people . The country of Vietnam , for example , has experienced a population boom in recent years , which could be said to have contributed significantly to its major cities of Hanoi and Saigon being ranked two of the most polluted in the world . Thus , some argue that we must push for government intervention in education to improve sex education and decrease birth rates . Teaching children on how to prevent unwanted pregnancies through the use of contraception or birth control will not only help to improve the environment , but can also make the lives of would-be parents more comfortable as well . These benefits to the population are why countries such as India and China have launched massive campaigns to curb their population growth primarily , aimed at educating their young citizens to be more responsible", "There have been many reports showing that employees who have just finished college are lacking interpersonal skills . I think negligence in building up those skills during college can be one of the causes . However , there are many solutions to this problem . There can be many causes for this lack of interpersonal abilities . Firstly , this is due to the fact that many people , especially those who live in college are too focused on studying and do not pay enough attention to the importance of these skills . Because they do not understand how crucial these skills are , and in their work lives , they do not bother to acquire them . Secondly , the environment in colleges places little emphasis on developing extracurricular activities for students . There are very few organizations for students to participate in and build up on their teamwork abilities . However , I think there are many ways that we can improve this situation . Firstly , schools should have more clubs and events for students to take part in so they have the chance to expand their network . By this way , students can foster and strengthen their interpersonal skills . Moreover , students should be encouraged to find internships during the summer or other vacations . This will help them understand the reality of work life and thus , know where to improve themselves to work effectively . In conclusion , there are many reasons why young adults are lacking their transferable skills . One of the main causes is that people do not pay enough attention to building these skills", "Nowadays , there has been a drop in the number of people visiting art galleries . Although I think there are many reasons for this phenomenon , solutions to improve this problem are feasible . There are many reasons why I think that people are not interested in going to art galleries anymore . Firstly , the most famous art galleries charge visitors for an admission ticket or some form of entry fee . Because of this , many people hesitate to visit the galleries . This mindset especially applies to foreign tourists because they would rather spend time at other attractions . Secondly , young people nowadays have various entertainment forms to choose from , leading to art galleries receiving less attention than before . Many people also feel that these places are only for the elites or artistic people , so they would prefer to seek entertainment in movie theaters , coffee shops , or bookstores . Regardless of the reasons , there are many solutions that both art galleries\u2019 owners and society can take to attract more visitors . Firstly , schools can plan more excursions to art galleries , especially contemporary art exhibitions , to instill an interest in art in students . For example , schools can ask students to take notes while touring the gallery , then ask them to submit a summary of what they thought of the art pieces there . Secondly , art galleries should give out more discounts to the audience that are most likely to volunteer their time , such as senior citizens , students , or foreign tourists . For example , many famous art galleries and museums worldwide hold a \u201cpay as you wish\u201d day , where visitors can pay as little as one US cent for their visit . As a result , more people would willingly go to see art galleries . In conclusion , I believe there are many reasons why people are reluctant to pay a visit to art galleries", "Despite advice from experts , many senior citizens are not exercising enough , which leads to faster degradations of both mental and physical health . Although there are many reasons for this phenomenon , there are also feasible solutions . There are various reasons why older people do not exercise regularly . The lack of incentive is one of the biggest ones . Older people are more prone to fatigue due to deteriorating health . As a result , they do not want to participate in physical activities . In some cases , older people are susceptible to depression and other mental issues , lowering their incentive to get fit . Fear of injuries is another reason . People with heart diseases or skeletal problems should not participate in vigorous activities . Many adults discourage their parents from exercise out of fear that once an injury occurs , recovery takes forever . However , that is not to say that there are no solutions to encourage older people to get fit . The first solution is to focus more on consistency rather than the intensity of the training . Older people can do light exercises , like walking , simple stretching poses , or even swimming for a short while . These activities are low-risk but can help to improve mood and maintain physical fitness . The key is to develop a sense of self-discipline and a love for exercising . Another solution is to encourage them to socialize with other people their age . As a result , they can form exercise groups and socialize through physical activities . For example , many older people enjoy chatting with their friends while taking an afternoon stroll . In conclusion , the lack of incentive , combined with a fear of injuries , is why older people suffer from a lack of physical fitness", "\ufeffRising living costs have been an increasing concern for people in many countries . In this essay , I argue that this phenomenon will likely cause individuals mental illness , as well as huge societal rifts between rich and poor . Hence , I argue people should elect politicians who can implement progressive taxation to mitigate the consequences . As prices increase , the upper class continues to be able to provide for themselves since they have more income to spend , while the middle class is impacted by this to a much more significant degree , leading to the deteriorating mental health of the latter group . As basic amenities and rent begin to cost a bigger portion of middle-class incomes , more families would begin to slip into the working class category . In turn , this results in deteriorating mental health conditions for those on the wrong side of the wealth gap . Subsequently , class tensions will arise between the haves and have-nots , as we see in developed economies such as the United States and Britain , which often result in political fallout and instability . Therefore , I argue that countries with high costs of living should elect politicians who can distribute the income of the rich to help those at the lower echelons of society . This in turn creates a more equal society , where the rich and the poor have equal access to resources that can help them live a fulfilling life . Rich countries such as Norway and Sweden have done this effectively , resulting in their population reporting to be among the happiest in the world . This way , the costs of living might still be allowed to rise , however , the majority of the population will be able to share the burden more equally", "As population growth in urban areas is getting out of hand , and many people wonder about its effects . I think it brings many detrimental problems to society , but there are ways to reduce its span and prevent the problem from growing . \ufeffOverpopulation in metropolitan areas brings lots of problems to its inhabitants . The first and most immediate problem is competition for resources . More people means more housing is in demand . House prices and rents should expect a significant increase within only a few years . Groceries , gas , utilities , and even education costs should also expect the same trend . Moreover , the accumulation of natural resource depletion and emitted greenhouse gas problems will lead to pollution . In this environment , contagious diseases , such as COVID , HIV , or tuberculosis , spread faster than ever . However , there are measures that governments can take to alleviate the effects and prevent this problem . To alleviate the effects , each government needs to be prepared for the worst by investing now . They should build `more apartment buildings , schools , and supermarkets , grow more crops , and improve healthcare systems . One other solution is to develop satellite cities to decentralize the urban population . To prevent this problem from growing bigger than it already is , schools should educate students on birth control methods and safe sex practices . As a result , this will prevent unplanned pregnancies and reduce the rate of population growth . In conclusion , overpopulation in urban areas is a significant problem because it causes devastating effects on society", "Environmentalists have long given out warnings that climate change is real and will have dire consequences . However , many people refuse to change their habits . I think there are many reasons why they do so , but fortunately , there are also feasible solutions . Reluctance to change habits to prevent climate change has many causes . The first reason is that people do not take the climate change problem personally . Current reports emphasize damages done to future generations , which means many people have the misconception that this would not affect them . For example , many people think to themselves that climate change does not happen till they are already dead so that they can continue their habits . Another reason is the lack of a convenient and cheap solution . Many sustainable products , like water tumblers , organic bar soaps , or clothing , are too costly compared to single-use products and fast fashion items . Moreover , many countries , including Vietnam , do not have thorough reuse and recycle programs . However , there are some measures that both businesses and governments can take to encourage individuals to change their habits for the better . Firstly , shops and restaurants can offer discounts and reward points as incentives for people . For example , coffee shops can offer discounts when customers bring their own bottles , while makeup brands can give out vouchers when customers return used lotion jars or lipstick tubes . Secondly , governments can introduce special taxes or fines for those who refuse to change their habits . For example , Singapore has long been applying a strict punishment on anyone who litters , Canada is looking to entirely ban single-use products . Moreover , governments should investigate and take actions against businesses that involve unsustainable practices . In conclusion , there are many reasons why people refuse to change their habits to delay climate change", "A key aspect of the modern consumer society is that people tend to buy things more frequently . This can be attributed to various factors and lead to a number of undesirable effects . There are two main reasons for the ignition and acceleration of this throwaway lifestyle . For one thing , we are living in a consumer society in which newly released products bombard the market on a daily basis . This , in its turn , allows people to make regular purchases in order to keep up with the cutting- edge technology . Another major point to consider is the deliberate production of short-lived goods . The massive manufacturing industry of every country is expanding , resulting in increasing demand of people\u2019 consumption . This leads to the fact that consumer durables are being replaced gradually by other less durable goods . As a result , users are left with no chance but to throw away the broken products and opt for new ones . This can cause problems , the most obvious being the detrimental effects on the environment . Goods require not only raw materials such as wood , plastic and metals , but also energy in the form of oil and electricity , for example . Therefore , we are consuming these resources in far greater quantities since there are more people with the money to buy them , they are buying them at shorter intervals and the goods generally require more resources to manufacture . An example of this is the use of rare earth metals in the production of electronic goods . Another issue that economists have noted is that a throw-away society encourages people to spend rather than to save money . It is certainly economically advantageous to have people spending as this creates jobs . However , if people do not save enough to provide security in their old age or when they are ill , this becomes a problem", "It is true that nowadays people are shifting to larger cities . There are several negative consequences of this moot issue , and to cope with the current problems , the authorities should encourage individuals to move to smaller cities or even to the countryside . To begin with , an enormous number of people create problems . One negative consequence is that the urban population would go on increasing and cause housing problems . This leads to the creation of underdeveloped slum areas , where underprivileged individuals must live in poor living conditions like lacking medical care or even drinking water . Another issue is the traffic jam due to the burgeoning car ownership . Arguably , cars take up more space than a motorbike while its capacity to accommodate passengers is far inferior to that of a bus . This weakness results in bumper-to-bumper traffic , particularly in downtown areas where many drivers have to inch along to get away from the terrible traffic . Governments should take steps to move a certain number of city dwellers to less populated areas . The main reason is that shifting people to towns or even the countryside helps to decrease the unemployment rate . This is because as more and more people apply for the same position within a company , it may intensify the competition among employees , making it significantly more difficult to be chosen . Towns , however , due to industrialization , are now able to provide different jobs for engineers or officers in new factories . Therefore , by encouraging job seekers to move to these newly developed areas , the government can lower the number of unemployed individuals in cities", "Money-related topics , such as how much one earns or spends , are becoming more commonplace in everyday discussions across many countries . I believe this trend arises because of money's centrality in daily life . However , doing so is counterproductive since it might create a materialistic and prejudiced worldview . On the one hand , people often discuss money due to its relevance in everyday life . We all require a certain amount of money to afford necessities like food and housing , not to mention additional services such as healthcare and education . Because of this , most people put a high value on financial security and devote mental energy to contemplating financial matters . Consequently , it is logical why many individuals need to verbalize their emotions and worries around finances . In addition , discussing financial matters is considered normal and natural discourse in several regions and cultures . It is a wonderful conversation starter , and if the individual has a prestigious job , it may even earn admiration from others . Nevertheless , I feel that discussing such sensitive information is inappropriate . Being excessively preoccupied with wealth might lead to an obsession with material possessions . The reason is that superficial appearances are given more weight in social evaluations than essential character qualities . Secondly , this practice may foster discrimination . Teenagers who are financially unable to purchase expensive clothing already sometimes face humiliation and mockery from their peers . There is already evidence of this trend in nations where wealth is revered , such as China , where young people shame one another and parents shun offspring based on their economic prospects . In conclusion , due to the significance of money in everyday life , addressing one's financial condition is becoming more prevalent in many countries", "Today , science education is under-represented in several nations . These subjects require significant effort and time to master , and they have a reputation for being extremely challenging . If this trend continues unchecked , it will impede the country's technical progress , which would indirectly affect our standard of living . The widespread lack of interest in science , technology , engineering , and math is due primarily to two causes . It is important to note that such topics are notoriously difficult and necessitate a tremendous amount of hard work , dedication , and wit . Many potential biology majors are dissuaded from pursuing the field because of the sheer volume of research required of each student . Furthermore , the job market is exceedingly competitive , and there is a severe lack of positions in this industry . Even if a significant amount of energy and time is devoted to science education in school , there is still a low likelihood of employment following graduation . This is because society places a higher value on money than on research , and hence only finance majors are hired . The fall in the number of scientists also means fewer scientific achievements , making it more challenging to raise living standards . Scientists work on various initiatives with the overarching goal of making the world a better place for future generations . While scientists may not generate profits for the country straightaway , they have historically produced useful technologies like automobiles , the Internet , and electricity . Ultimately , fewer science majors mean less scientific discovery; technological progress would stagnate without scientists , and fewer life-enhancing breakthroughs would be made . In conclusion , the difficulty and devotion necessary to study science are two significant reasons for the scarcity of scientific students", "Today , the written language of many people is more casual and conversational than that of others . The two primary contributors are modern technological innovations and the casual , convivial informal communication style . This development is a massive step in the right direction since it will make exchanging information more straightforward and more approachable . First , the proliferation of contemporary technology , such as the Internet and messaging applications , is the principal cause of widespread informal language . From WhatsApp to Facebook Messenger , endless platforms are integrated with an instant messaging feature . As Internet users rise , the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases and humorous expressions has grown increasingly prevalent . Another reason is that working lives would seem uninviting and hostile without informal communication . Indeed , informal one-liner messages and casual encounters often bond a business together . They enable the on-boarding of new staff and the exchange of knowledge more efficiently . Personally , the tendency to adopt casual written language offers clear benefits . First , informal communication through texting or post-it notes is faster and simpler to understand , and anybody may utilize it in any circumstance . Formality also impairs communication flexibility . For instance , everyday language enables employees to access several channels simultaneously , such as text messages , Facebook messages , and Tweets , rather than being confined to email alone . Moreover , the formal structure of employee engagement may be intimidating , which is where an informal approach can be beneficial . If an employee is not reaching required standards or punctuality , a lighthearted text message containing emojis may typically resolve the issue . On the other side , officially documenting these occurrences might undermine the employee's loyalty and confidence . In conclusion , the Internet and informality's pleasant nature are the two most influential factors in the rising popularity of the informal language", "\ufeffAncestral lineage research has been argued by many people to be important in recent times . In this essay , I will seek to show why individuals in certain regions make an endeavor in knowing more about their families and reach an accord that the phenomenon is positive . The trend of discovering family history can be explained by the urge to get closer to one\u2019s own family and the desire to learn about the health records of the family . Concerning the former reason , it is true that ancestral lineage research enables the reconnection of family members . This could potentially be of great comfort to orphans or those who do not know who their parents are . DNA tests , for example , have helped many people without family to track down their long-lost relatives and discover brothers and sisters they never knew they had . Turning to the second point , knowing the medical history of a family enhances the understanding of genetically inheritable medical conditions such as asthma , obesity , and diabetes . Therefore , people would take appropriate action to identify ways to mitigate the adverse effects of diseases . From my perspective , the overwhelming desire of finding family history can be deemed positive due to its role in preserving familial culture and customs and motivating individuals to overcome life\u2019s troubles . Chief among these is that the discovery of ancestry plays a crucial role in maintaining the culture and traditions of one\u2019s family . Once the descendants are fully aware of the significance of cultural values passed down from previous generations , they would show more willingness in preserving as well as promoting those intangible merits . Moreover , a means of self-motivation can be regarded as one of the worth-mentioning advantages of examining family roots . During the discovery , people would be more mindful of obstacles that their ancestors overcame , thereby driving them to be bold and brave in dealing with issues in life . In conclusion , research on ancestors is prompted by the desire to form a close bond with former generations and to know about familial health records", "\ufeffThe deterioration of environment has been one of the major issues that need urgent action to be addressed . I believe that air pollution and deforestation are the main culprits of this phenomenon . Therefore , both parties , namely individuals and governments , should ensure accountability to solve the problem . The two main factors behind this degradation are contaminated air and clearing forests . Concerning the former , the excessive growth of industrial production combined with the substantial increase in the number of transportation leads to the disposal of harmful gases to the environment . These substances are generally considered as the key factor destroying the ozone layer which protects the Earth from detrimental effects of ultraviolet rays . The second point is that overpopulation and lucrative timber harvesting have negatively driven people to deforest . As a result , some adversely worth-concerning consequences are animals\u2019 struggling to survive and the frequent occurrence of natural disasters , which creates an imbalance in the whole ecosystem . Both authorities and individuals are accountable for the issue of environmental damage . Obviously , governments have to pioneer in saving the environment as those competent authorities can make collaborative efforts in enacting new international laws which ensure citizens\u2019 compliance with all regulations in protecting our surroundings . In addition , each person is responsible for not doing harm to the environment as his or her daily performance would directly impact the habitat . For example , provided that individuals awareness of reducing plastic use on a daily basis , the total amount of this substance disposed to the environment would significantly plummet", "As the market is expanding , resulting in increased competition , businesses must come up with innovative ways to increase sales and their presence in the customer\u2019s mind . While there are various marketing strategies that a firm can adopt , the most effective one must be possessing a unique and desirable product . To begin with , companies can take on different branding schemes in order to boost their profit . One of which is to increase their product\u2019s physical presence . By making frequent appearances in a consumer\u2019s shopping addresses , the shopper is prompted to buy the goods out of curiosity . Another strategy is to offer promotions such as discounts and gifts along with purchases . With the help of tempting phrases like \u201clast chance\u201d , \u201cbiggest of the year\u201d , and et cetera , this scheme hits most people\u2019s fear of missing out and thus motivates them to make a purchase even if they have no need for it . Nevertheless , among all strategies that a company can adopt to increase sales , I believe that the most effective one is to own a one-of-a-kind and sought-after product . In this case , the business enjoys the advantages of being a market leader , with the most outstanding one being near-zero competition . Furthermore , as the product creates its own segment in the market , the company can have full control over the price and distribution , which will not be viable if the product is a duplicate . For example , that the iPhone is a pioneer in the smartphone industry has enabled Apple to still make huge profits off iPhones though competition has gotten more cut-throat , thanks to its expensive price tag and well-known brand", "In modern society , people have the tendency to spend less time with their family members . From my point of view , this development can be attributed to several reasons and have negative effects on both the individual and their family . To start with , people\u2019s declining amount of time spent with their family stems from the generation gap and the boom of personal entertainment choices . First of all , the generation gap has been a longstanding problem . Due to a disparity in beliefs between ages , a lack of understanding is born , making one generation in a family feel less sympathetic towards another generation\u2019s problems . Thus , cross-generational communication becomes less enjoyable for all parties . Secondly , more personal entertainment choices are readily available now , reducing people\u2019s need to partake in other activities . While in former times , people could only talk to one another or take part in outdoor activities , nowadays , people are engrossed in unlimited forms of entertainment , and neglecting to spend time with their families . The tendency of sparing less time with their family brings both the individual and the family undesirable impacts . Firstly , individuals who are not close with their family tend to be more problematic . Children growing up without parental love are more susceptible to emotional problems such as being emotionally detached or having low self-esteem from feeling undesired . As a family is everyone\u2019s basic need , what living apart does is taking away one of life\u2019s necessities . Moreover , with weak ties , families can be broken apart . This is because the basic function of a family is to support each other , without quality time together , this goal cannot be achieved . In conclusion , the trend of spending less time with family comes from the generation gap and the increase of personal entertainment forms", "In recent years , it has been noticeable that the university entrance exam is getting increasingly competitive , and some have questioned why or whether this is a positive development . I believe there are two main reasons for this , and I don\u2019t think this is either an entirely positive or negative phenomenon . The first reason why attending tertiary education nowadays is more competitive than ever is due to the vast investment of parents into their children\u2019s education . In the past , it was acceptable for a child to drop out of school to help with farming . However , most parents now want to ensure a better future for their kids , so they urge them to compete for a slot in the most prestigious university possible . The second reason why universities are getting harder to get into is simply because of the rising population of high schoolers . More universities should have been built to accommodate this demand from upcoming generations . However , because the rate of opening new colleges cannot compete with that of population rise , children would have to compete against one another for college admissions . Regardless of the reason for this development , I do not see this as entirely positive nor negative . On the one hand , there are some benefits to this . Future generations will be more knowledgeable than the current ones . With an influx of fresh graduates equipped with high-level knowledge , the country can expect more technological developments . This can be seen from the growth of entrepreneurship in the technology industry . On the other hand , however , this intense competition will take a toll on both students and parents . More time will be spent studying for the exam , which equates to deteriorating physical and mental health of high schoolers . Parents are also affected by the mental and financial pressure of finding and paying for tutoring centers . In conclusion , getting into colleges is more competitive due to children being more competitive and the population rising", "Recently , some countries have brought in laws to limit working hours . I think this decision comes from wanting to protect employees\u2019 health and rights , and it is a beneficial one in many ways . Firstly , from my understanding , I think this development stems from wanting to improve workers\u2019 health , especially if they\u2019re working in an office environment . Many office workers suffer from health problems such as back and neck pains , migraines , and sleep deprivation . Overworking seems to be the common cause of these problems . By restricting working hours , employees have more time to rest , thus improving their health . Another reason why I think countries introduce this law is to protect employees from being abused by employers . For example , it is common nowadays that marketing agency employees are expected to not leave until meeting their deadlines , which means they work overtime without getting paid . Regardless of the reason , I think that this is something to be encouraged . Firstly , limiting working hours will help improve employees\u2019 moods as they do not have to overwork anymore . As a result , the relationship between corporate and employees improves , leading to a warmer cooperation attitude . Secondly , although it may come as a surprise , there have been studies showing that productivity is boosted by limiting working hours . These studies point out that working shorter shifts will help employees stay more focused as it does not take as much a toll on workers\u2019 physical and mental health , hence improving productivity for the whole workplace . This is especially true for factory workers , as repetitive motions can cause drowsiness , so limiting working hours keeps their minds sharper . In conclusion , I understand that countries introduced this law to limit working hours to protect employees\u2019 rights and health", "It is an observed trend worldwide that many people are currently residing in urban areas . I think that there are multiple reasons why people want to live in metropolitan areas . However , urban life is littered with various problems . Firstly , it is undeniable that big cities are often in demand for a large number of workers . Many well-known and multinational corporations have their headquarters in urban areas , which is why young professionals and college students move here in search of a bright career path . Another reason why life in the city is so attractive to people is the convenience it offers . There are many options for choosing the appropriate healthcare facilities , ranging from public hospitals to private clinics and even personal doctors . Most top schools are in central districts and are relatively close to residential areas . Markets , supermarkets , and convenience stores are an ubiquitous part of the streets . Altogether , this makes urban life convenient for its citizens , where all the resources are readily available . However , there are lots of problems associated with people migrating to big cities . The first and most self-evident reason is rising housing prices . Being able to afford adequate housing is becoming more difficult each year , as housing prices and rents keep rising due to the massive influx of migrants to Ho Chi Minh city , for example . The second problem is that crime rates are significantly higher in cities compared to rural and suburban areas . Due to the gap between the rich and the poor , combined with the high population density , thefts and robberies are a common sight in Ho Chi Minh city . In conclusion , there are multiple reasons why people are attracted to city life , mainly because of its convenience and a great demand for the workforce", "With the advancement of healthcare , people now live way long after their retirement age . This means that laborers are retiring too soon these days , causing some adverse effects on both individuals and society . Luckily , there are some ways to tackle this problem . Retiring when one is still physically and mentally sound means that one is prone to negative feelings after retirement . For example , especially when they are the key member of the staff , people usually feel left out or being redundant when they retire while still having the ability to contribute . Society would also experience a loss from having people retire when people are still capable of doing their jobs . For example , in industries where experiences are more valuable than qualifications , like in academia , having a professor retire when he or she can still teach is a waste of major human resource , as he or she is the most capable person for teaching . However , the government and businesses can and have carried multiple solutions to lessen the effects of this issue . The first measure is gradually lifting the retirement age . The government is implementing this solution by increasing the retirement age by a few months every year . This can ensure that people retire when they are no longer fit for the job . A second solution is to offer positions that do not require constant time or physical effort to retired people . For example , many companies still offer retired employees the advisor position . Other retired employees from famous companies still find themselves giving motivational speeches to college students or fresh graduates as a way to become engaged after retirement . In conclusion , having people retire when they are still capable is causing pressure to those individuals and society", "As countries are developing , more people are purchasing and using cars , despite apparent environmental damages . I think freedom to travel and other conveniences are why people do this . However , there are things we can do to put the situation under control . \ufeffFlexibility in traveling is one of the top reasons people prefer to travel by cars to other means of transport . Traveling by car means you can add multiple stops anytime and don't have to adhere to bus schedules . For example , you can stop to buy street snacks or suddenly decide to drop by a friend\u2019s house . Cars are also convenient for other reasons . Having a car means you can carry around more stuff , which is helpful for grocery trips or a weekend picnic . You do not have to worry about planning the route like when riding buses , which involves lots of bus switching because most cars now come with GPS . You also can travel with lots of people and have private conversations with them . However , due to the detrimental effects on the environment , the number of cars should be controlled . The first way to achieve the effect is to introduce laws to restrict the number of cars a family can own . For example , families of less than five people should not own more than two cars since they most probably have at least one motorbike already . Also , family members can pick up others instead of having two cars . Another solution is to encourage ride-sharing apps or programs . For example , the ride-sharing feature on Uber offers riders a discounted price to travel with another passenger . Ride-sharing programs can be implemented at the workplace , where colleagues can give one another lifts to work or home . Inconclusion , there are many reasons why the manufacture and use of cars are becoming more popular", "Many psychological researchers advocate that we can study the actions of children in order to determine their potential to become future criminals , while others believe that this is neither accurate nor ethical . In my opinion , the environment is a much larger factor in individuals\u2019 propensity to commit crimes , and therefore , such endeavours will not stop children from breaking the law in the future . Firstly , it could be argued that there are indeed biological factors that can predispose individuals to certain behaviours , including antisocial ones . Theories of natural selection suggest that the gene for aggressiveness can be passed down through generations , as it was more likely to help previous humans survive . Therefore , if we are able to discern which mechanisms in the brain can trigger such emotional responses in children , we might be able to identify which children are at risk of becoming criminals . For instance , brain scans studies have shown that criminals who have committed crimes but pleaded insanity have a less developed amygdala than normal people . On the other hand , it could be said that seeing crime as an individual issue takes away the collective responsibility of taking care of children so that they do not have to resort to crime . Studies show that there is a direct correlation between poverty and crime rates - thus , it is safe to infer that individuals are much a product of their circumstance as much as their genetics . If children are raised in an area with ample economic opportunities , I argue that it is likely they will commit less crimes in the future . Therefore , efforts to predict children\u2019s behavioural patterns should instead be redirected to providing for their needs . Overall , I believe that while a neuropsychological approach to crime can be attractive , it is far too simplistic and takes into account an inadequate role of nurture", "In the modern workplace , getting promoted is easily one of the biggest goals any employee can have . Although there are various reasons to want promotions , there are other motivations for working hard . A promotion usually means more job and financial security to employees . Being promoted means that you are less likely to be replaced when companies are going through a purge . Along with the promotion , employees are likely to have a salary raise , which is the most common motivation for people to want promotions . Another reason why people work so hard to climb the ladder in corporations can be personal gratification . Being promoted means one is in a higher social status and has proven to be a competent person , which are all the reasons for personal pleasure . However , there are multiple other ways to incentivize employees to work hard without involving a promotion . The first motivation comes in the form of healthy competition between colleagues . In a community where workers are challenged against one another to deliver the best results , it will create a drive to work harder . This should be noted , though , that this healthy competitive attitude can turn into aggressive workplace politics if not supervised . Another motivation is when employees feel that they are serving a greater purpose doing their jobs . For example , doctors and nurses work harder than any other profession because they feel they have the responsibility to save lives . In conclusion , the promise of being promoted motivates employees to work hard in various ways", "Television channels today regularly devote more air time to men\u2019s sporting events over women\u2019s . Personally , I believe that the reasons for this are financial , and whilst efforts should be made to give equal time to men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports , viewership means that this would be a difficult task . Firstly , the main consideration of television channels and studio executives to prioritise men's sports is viewership , as more views mean more advertising revenue . Television channels need to make a decision on how best to utilize the amount of time they have in order to secure the highest ratings , and the reality is that men\u2019s sports tend to be more popular than women\u2019s sports . The men\u2019s World Cup Finals , for example , had viewership in the billions , whilst this number was much lower for the womens\u2019 World Cup . Since TV channels\u2019 main purpose is to make money , it is not difficult to see why they would prefer to showcase men\u2019s sports over women\u2019s . However , there is the consideration that giving women sports more publicity can help to alter public perception over time . If something gets a huge amount of newspaper , radio , and television coverage for decades , it is unsurprising that it would eventually become popular . Therefore , what may help make the world of sports coverage less divided would be to report more on women\u2019s sports and to increase its air time . The overwhelming popularity of women\u2019s football in the United States , for example , provides a stunning testament to the ability of the media to be able to thrust women\u2019s sports into the limelight . Applying this method to other sports might mean they can become popular as well . In conclusion , I argue that the reason why men\u2019s sports have been given more coverage than women\u2019s is due to ratings playing a fundamental role in how media companies operate", "Nowadays , it is reported that parents are not spending enough time with their children . There are multiple reasons for this , and out of the two parties , the issue tends to affect children more than parents . The first reason why parents neglect their children is their hectic schedules . Many parents currently work more than one job , and they also have to socialize and network with friends and colleagues . Some even have to take care of their elderly parents . Children are also busy studying , hanging out with friends , or dating . Another reason could be that both parties have differences in viewpoints . Parents can be condescending towards their children , resulting in banning them from doing things they are interested in , such as getting tattoos , dyeing hair , or wearing revealing clothes . On the other hand , children also lack the patience to communicate with their parents respectfully . As a result , children and parents actively avoid spending time with one another . Although this negligence affects both parents and children , children are still getting the more negative end . Children naturally look up to and copy their parents . As a result , when parents do not spend enough time with their children , children can lack communication and other soft skills , become more distrustful , or treat their future children in the same way . Moreover , children , especially teens , are more emotionally sensitive than parents . This negligence can be detrimental to their mental state . For example , this lack of care can easily imprint in their minds that their parents do not love them , they are worthy of being isolated , and that they cannot find solace in the home . Many suicide cases have resulted from parents not spending time with their children . In conclusion , it is understandable why parents do not spend enough time with their children", "More people today find themselves interested in travelling to foreign nations . I believe that this phenomena is a result of increased access to information on social media , and yet is fundamentally adverse to the local cultures that experience mass tourism . Firstly , I believe that social media has allowed people to catch a glimpse of foreign locales , which in turn entices them to visit destinations that they otherwise would not have before . When people see travel adverts through online platforms , they are compelled to explore it themselves and showcase their experience on social media . This is why many people on the internet today have been able to create a career out of travelling and posting pictures on the internet alone: there is a huge market for the advertisements of travel destinations on apps such as Instagram and Facebook today . However , increased travel to tourist destinations has inadvertently internationalized them over time as governments and urban planners aim to make the stay of rich foreign tourists more comfortable and luxurious . Gradually , little by little of what makes the place special is replaced by a generic , commercialized shell . This creates a situation in places such as Angkor Wat in Cambodia , where the serenity of the temples is destroyed by the overwhelming number of tourists . Overall , I believe that the rise of the internet and social media in particular has contributed to the proliferation of global travel . Nevertheless , tourism has thrived at the expense of the destinations' local cultures", "Nowadays , more students are choosing not to enroll in science majors in universities . This problem stems from various reasons , and it is more serious than most people think because it is detrimental to society . It is understandable why many stay away from studying science . The first reason is that students do not have bright career prospects in science . Scientists , lab technicians , or engineers are underpaid compared to their efforts to get to those positions . Moreover , some companies are heavily bureaucratic , especially when it comes to research positions , which further discourage students from studying science . Another reason is the way universities teach science subjects . Most classes focus solely on too much math and complex problems that do not have many applications . This , combined with little interactivity in classrooms , outdated information and lab equipment is why enrollment in science majors is dropping . The government and society should take this problem more seriously because it has adverse effects . Fewer science majors mean fewer R&D activities . For example , most factories in Vietnam such as Samsung and Unilever , only focus on assembly and production according to foreign procedures and recipes . In the long run , foreign technological companies will treat Vietnam as a source of cheap employment for their production lines . Another reason why this would be a problem is that the general public will have distorted views about science . The US society is currently suffering from this problem directly . Too few people pursuing studies in science leads to an ignorant and distrustful society . This kind of society readily falls victim to conspiracy theories , like the flat-earth or the anti-vaccine movements . In conclusion , it is reasonable why many students choose not to study science at a higher-education level", "The prospect of an ideal society has captivated human thought for centuries , yet in practice , most of these ideas have failed to be realized . In my opinion , because people disagree fundamentally on what utopia is , it is difficult to implement it . I argue that utopias are also an obstacle to human progress , for it removes the need for suffering , which is fundamental for finding meaning . Firstly , it is impossible to actually describe a utopian society that works for everyone , since every person has a different idea of what utopia constitutes . When two conflicting views of the ideal society come into conflict , the use of force might have to be used in order to implement one version of reality over the other . For example , whilst one person might envision an ideal society as one where they can do business as they please , many others might view a utopia as one where private property and businesses are abolished , and where people do not have to work . It is simply impossible to reconcile the two , and attempts at implementing utopia might fall apart upon disagreement . Secondly , it could be argued that there is an innate metaphysical value to suffering that utopias would eradicate . Suffering could be said to be essential to us , for it is what provides meaning to our lives - to live in utopia , where there is no suffering , could be to abandon all meaning . For example , even though child-rearing can often be very difficult , many parents still endure hardship for their children because they view it as a meaningful endeavor . In a utopia , where everyone could get everything they want , it might be said that there may be no motivation to embark on meaningful pursuits . On the whole , I believe that ideal societies are impossible to build by their very nature whilst removing any sort of meaning itself", "In many countries , many young adults set out to be homeowners by 30 years old , not opting for renting . I think there are multiple motivations for this aspiration , and this is a positive way of thinking . One of the most important reasons why people do not want to rent houses or apartments is because they are dependent on landlords or potential roommates . Owning a home means you are in total control of how your house looks like , how many people it hosts , or even how many utilities it uses . Landlords can also throw people out at any moment during their rent or , in many cases , can break into tenants\u2019 space at their convenience . Moreover , owning a home also means an elevated social status . You are now considered a functional , successful , responsible adult . For most men , you are also considered a better candidate for marriage because you are now ready to welcome a new family into your home . I think , generally , this is a positive development for individuals . Switching from a rented property to an owned home benefits individuals financially . Because tenants depend on landlords to control the rent , they usually waste more money renting a place for a long time than owning one . Owned houses are also an investment as many houses can gain value over the time that owners stay there . For example , houses in Go Vap District now triple in value compared to what they used to be a decade ago . Another reason why people want to be a homeowner is due to the positive correlation between owning a home and better mental health . Owning a home usually means a sign that adults have made it in their lives , which in turn eases the mind of adults . For some , home-owning even means increased privacy . In conclusion , wanting independence from landlords and elevating their social status are reasons people want to own a home", "Many parents nowadays are pressuring their children to be successful and willing to take any action to ensure that . I think the competitive state of current society contributes to this , and that this is mostly a negative development . I am sure parents who are obsessed with their children\u2019s success have their reasons to be so . Most of them have more resources to invest , such as money to send kids to cram schools or to find the best tutor . There are many learning resources available as well , like art schools or soft skills workshops . Parents overwhelmed by these resources will try to send their kids to each one possible . Another reason is the competitive state of current society . Reunions for adults now are just opportunities for parents to brag about their kids , which strengthens the belief that parents need to expect more from their kids . How society perceives parents depends on their children\u2019s achievements . Regardless of the reasons for this development , it is indeed detrimental for both parents and children . The obsession with success is mentally exhausting for both parties when they constantly worry about how others are doing and how to improve . Many teens and young adults fall into depression , anxiety , and extreme stress due to this . The rates of adolescent mental health problems and suicide are both higher than ever before , which is proof of this burnout . Moreover , this obsession with success that parents channel on their children puts a strain on their relationships with one another . This generation is witnessing many children choosing to spend less time with their parents to avoid being scrutinized and berated . In conclusion , it is understandable that parents expect more from their children in terms of personal success", "More developing countries are improving their tourism industries . Personally , I argue that this is a result of the improvement in the aviation industry , and it is on the whole , not a positive development; this is because the inevitable result of the rise of tourist industries is the corruption of local cultures in an attempt to appeal to tourists . As production technology improves , it is now cheaper than ever to manufacture planes , diminishing the cost of international travel to developing countries . Technological improvements decrease the dependency upon human labor , which is often more expensive in the long run than machines for producing products such as airplanes . Furthermore , as companies grow , they acquire economies of scale , which means that the average cost of producing each unit decreases . This culminates in aviation companies such as Boeing being able to create vast quantities of planes every year , and flight agencies being able to offer flights to more far-fetched locations . However , I argue that this rise in tourism to developing countries inevitably forces unwanted constraints on the locals as expectations of their cultural impact how many people come to visit and spend their disposable income on the local tourist industry , and as time goes on , the culture becomes performative and begins to lose its significance . Local populations , due to the imposition from markets , have to modify traditional customs in order to please foreign visitors , over time leaving behind a destination of little authenticity . \u201cOvercommercialization\" of cities is a recent yet prevalent phenomenon that can actually hurt the tourism industry in the long run", "More and more employers these days are recruiting new staff based on qualifications rather than on personal experience and values . There is one main reason for this trend , and it has both negative and positive impacts . Clearly , in today\u2019s job market , formal academic qualifications can be valued over life experience and personal qualities for one major reason . While the experience and personality one has may be hard for a recruiter to assess , degrees and certificates are reliable indicators of whether that person fits the position . For example , in fields such as IT where a strong relevant background is necessary , applicants with qualifications in programming often impress employers more than those who only possess good life skills or personal traits . In fact , this trend is either positive or negative development . On the one hand , this trend leads to young people focusing on gaining more qualifications , which means they need to work harder if they wish to leave school with a good degree . This is particularly beneficial because the huge amount of knowledge gained when preparing for school exams can be helpful for their working life at a later stage . On the other hand , such an exam-focused education system can be negative in the sense that many students might try to gain two or three degrees at the expense of life experience and personal values . This would be serious because examples of successful people who dropped out of university including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg suggest that qualities such as acumen and confidence rather than degrees is vital . In conclusion , compared with life experience and personal traits , qualifications are a better indicator for employers to assess potential employees"]
