                "There is widespread concern that the prevalence of instantaneous communication tools negatively impacts interpersonal bonds. I disagree completely with this viewpoint because of how modern communication facilitates not just long-distance interactions but also global social engagement.",
                "Some worry that individuals may grow more isolated if more convenient modes of communication, such as smartphones and social media, become the norm. They argue that by emphasizing virtual communication over real-world encounters, these technologies risk weakening the foundations of interpersonal bonds. This assertion, however, is vastly inflated. Virtual communication actually strengthens interpersonal bonds rather than weakening them. Most Facebook users, for instance, have face-to-face conversations with friends and coworkers in addition to exchanging messages online. Facebook's additional tools, such as instant messaging and video chatting, do not replace face-to-face communication but rather help us maintain relationships over great distances.",
                "In addition to addressing the issue of distance, as stated above, these technologies also allow us to widen our social networks. Some examples of such communities are online forums like Reddit, which bring together people with a shared interest in the arts, history, video games, or linguistics, and photo-sharing applications like Pinterest, which may bring together a group of individuals with similar tastes in photography. These communities allow for in-depth conversations and debates on a global scale, something that is difficult to do in person. Therefore, advances in communication have not been at the expense of interpersonal connections but rather have strengthened them.",
                "In conclusion, I am confident that the advancements in communication technology have made it possible for people to maintain long-distance connections and participate in the social life on a global scale."

                "In some elements of being a leader, women are superior to men for several reasons. In terms of compassion and teamwork, women tend to surpass males. Ultimately, these two characteristics will produce competent leaders. Numerous sovereign states, such as Germany and Finland, have had female officials, and the majority of these nations are recognized for exercising caution in the majority of their judgments, granting more rights to community members, and eliminating the gender pay gap. Regarding their international relations, these countries are typically commended for their amicable connections.",
                "However, research shows that men may be superior to women in their capacity to think strategically. Leaders with this skill have a better probability of making decisions that will favor their teams and businesses. Across the board, men dominate senior management ranks and are widely recognized as experts in a wide range of fields. In addition, women are impractically constrained by responsibilities outside leadership jobs, such as managing work and family. Pregnancy, for instance, often necessitates time off from work for women but not for males.",
                "In conclusion, I consider both men and women to have something valuable to contribute and are capable of serving as effective leaders. This is because women would be more advantageous regarding compassion and collaboration, while males are exempt from domestic duties and provide tactical benefits."

                "On the one hand, it seems logical that the primary objective of companies engaged in a free market should be to achieve sound financial health. Every form of organization incurs expenditures. Office space, legal costs, payroll, company credit cards, and other institutional expenditures may rise exponentially. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, the average cost to establish a micro-business is approximately $3,000, whereas the estimated cost to initiate a home-based franchise is almost $5,000. In addition to these one-time fees, utilities and other recurring expenses must also be paid periodically. Without being realistic about a startup's financial flow and debt, the owner will be unable to operate. In these situations, the societal obligations of a company become obsolete.",
                "On the other hand, there is no distinction between individuals and businesses regarding their ethical responsibilities. Given that social evils are solvable, businesses should share equal accountability with governments for society's betterment. For instance, the Vietnamese YouTube channel \"Quang Linh Vlogs\" has received enthusiastic support from both Vietnamese and Angolans. In the recordings, Linh and his team instruct local Angolans on how to grow vegetables and raise livestock. Linh also launched a social project to assist 5,000 underprivileged children in school by renovating and equipping classrooms. They proved that it is more humanitarian for businesses to contribute to society than to maximize revenue.",

                "One may argue that raising gas prices would have a discernible effect. This is because vehicle ownership is on the rise around the globe in both developing and industrialized nations. However, suppose the expense of daily commuting surpasses the benefits it would provide to a family already having trouble making ends meet each month. In that case, that family may choose other methods of transportation instead. Therefore, the number of personal vehicles would decrease as people adjust to higher petrol prices and opt for more affordable transportation, including walking, bicycling, carpooling, and public transit. This, in turn, lessens CO2 emissions, one of the significant factors in the world\u2019s environmental problems.",
                "On the other hand, a more substantial impact might be achieved by other policies that do not unintentionally target the less fortunate. Since most tiny levies would not deter upper-class individuals, it is doubtful that the solution above will have the intended effect. Instead, governments should consider everything from deforestation and disposable plastics to industrial fossil fuel usage. Governments must deploy a wider range of strategies, including higher taxes, stricter laws, and educational campaigns, to effectively and sustainably tackle these concerns. As demonstrated, addressing a single factor, like fuel cost, will have a negligible effect, while seeking a broader environmental strategic approach would be more beneficial.",
                "In conclusion, even though increasing gasoline prices might reduce vehicle emissions to some extent, I feel that evenly allocating government resources to combat several fronts is a more effective strategy."

Many individuals, for example, listen to music and dance in more dynamic contexts, such as casinos and bars. Other people resort to music to cope or boost their spirits through difficult emotional times, such as after a messy divorce or the passing of a beloved family. Furthermore, for some, music is also a humanly engineered creative process concerned with harmonizing voice or instrumental sounds to show emotional expression. Countless studies have shown that regardless of artistic medium, creating a piece of art, or in this example, a musical performance, may lessen one's stress levels by focusing on creativity.",

People relax in various ways, which might include dancing, emotionally engaging with music, or admiring art. The majority of adults, on the other hand, just consume music throughout the day to alleviate the stresses and obligations of parenthood and work. Additionally, research confirms that listening to music seems to be able to change brain functioning to the same extent as medication, thus concluding that music is an easy stress reduction tool that almost anybody can access. This explains why music appeals to children, teenagers, and adults, particularly after a long day of work or study.",

It is thought that only the government, with the well-being of the entire population in mind, can continually invest in these initiatives and will not sacrifice the long-term purpose for a short-term financial benefit. Second, some scientific endeavors, if allowed unchecked, are likely to produce social or ethical difficulties, undermining society's value. For instance, genetic engineering technology has sparked several debates and is presently subject to government oversight. Finally, most science funding comes from tax income; as a result, individuals want their tax dollars to be used under the supervision of government officials.",
                "Nevertheless, as long as these technological programs are driven by the government, I believe private sector engagement will undoubtedly contribute to the end aim. The fundamental reason is that government personnel are not professionals in either the scientific or business sectors, but private funds are more specialized in the implementation of scientific achievements since they are profit-driven. With genuine economic rewards achieved by those studies, relevant employees may be more encouraged to do more research. Furthermore, government personnel are occasionally understaffed and inefficient. Without such teamwork, people risk becoming overwhelmed by the volume of work and communication.",

Even in the young, there are numerous phone applications for students to receive and turn in home assignments. Evidently, this need to stay constantly connected is stressful and exhausting. Another point worth considering is that daily entertainment is also linked with technological devices such as televisions, computers, or smartphones, all of which are extremely addictive. Reports from multiple countries have shown that there is irreversible damage to human brains from excessive screen-time usage. It is scientifically proven that people with this addiction experienced a decrease in grey matter volume in critical areas, a condition similarly observed in those with a substance use disorder.",

In fact, due to medical advances, doctors are now able to diagnose health problems 300% more accurately than just five decades ago. This greatly facilitates timely intervention and improves positive outcomes. Furthermore, innovative medical products can now also replace and sustain failing body functions, thereby supporting people in living full and active lives. Additionally, the use of information and communication technologies plays a crucial role in providing a more accessible learning process. In the recent Covid-19 pandemic, for instance, \u201clearning poverty\u201d was at an all-time high for most underdeveloped countries.

From my perspective, I would express my strong opposition to that suggestion as broadcasting criminal cases through multimedia sites is beneficial in terms of educating citizens and exercising caution in dealing with serious offenses.",
                "On the one hand, the detailed description of crimes in newspapers and on TV would be disadvantageous due to the possibility that people would commit the same criminal acts and display anxiety toward the unsafe society. Regarding the former drawback, showing the wrongdoings of criminals publicly on media networks provides individuals with a clear understanding of how the infringement was conducted, from which they may learn and follow. As a consequence, there are high chances that those people, especially youngsters, would become potential offenders in the future. Not to mention that by televising a myriad of violation occurrences, mental health problems would experience a drastic increase since citizens are prone to develop anxiety toward an unsecured society.",
                "On the other hand, broadcasting more crime scenes on social media websites can be considered a means of education and caution for people. Chief among these is that broadcasting more violations of crimes in combination with their severe punishment plays a pivotal role in eradicating the intention of future offenders. Therefore, the increasing rate of the number of to-be-culprits would be significantly reduced. In addition, by exemplifying in detail the procedure of a breach, individuals would be more well-aware of the feasibility of a criminal case. Thus, they would have a tendency to prepare for approaches to avoid being victims of wrongdoings.",
                "In conclusion, although the display of criminal scenes should be limited due to their potential impact on increasing lawbreakers' and citizens' concerns, I am of the opinion that cases of violation of law should be shown on different media sites to educate and inform people about the risk of those offenses."

                "As the Internet and computer are becoming more prevalent than ever, many people question the necessity of cultural and historical museums. I strongly oppose the idea that information that is now easily accessible via the use of computers can replace museums.",
                "The first reason museums are irreplaceable is that the experience of visiting a museum is unique. Most museums nowadays offer a wider variety of information than that on the Internet. For example, museums have more exhibits, simply because some do not have the right to be posted online. Moreover, many exhibitions, especially cultural ones, use a combination of audio, lighting, or even scents to introduce the subject. Also, museum collections are carefully curated, which is not a feature found online. Curators work tirelessly to acquire and sort exhibits to present culture or a historical period as objectively and scientifically accurate as possible. All of these factors are mostly not available online, which is why museums are necessary.",
                "The second reason computers cannot replace museums is the information provided through the Internet is insufficient. A major problem with information online is that, unless it is posted on an academic or government-affiliated website, it is largely unverifiable. As a result, readers cannot grasp the full picture of the topic presented. Another problem with only relying on information online is that researching online requires people to first think of the subject. Few people do that. On the other hand, visiting museums can teach people things they might not expect. For example, many US tourists reportedly said that they surprisingly felt a need to review their understanding of the Vietnam War after they visited the US War Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. Without going to that museum, they might never think about such a topic for the rest of their lives.",
                "In conclusion, although the implementation of computers helps find general information on global culture and different historical periods, it cannot replace the experience of visiting a museum."

                "On the one hand, the significance of money earned by individuals from working has been attached to its paramount importance in fulfilling a desired life and solidifying one\u2019s social status. It goes without saying that the majority of people work in a financial-oriented way to support other aspects of life such as recreation, education, or healthcare. Without financial means, people would desperately struggle to equip themselves with knowledge and handle extreme emergencies. Not to mention that the more money people make, the more respect they can gain from others. Social status has long been ascribed to the sound financial stage that each person can reach. Therefore, people are more dedicated to working to earn more money with an aim of achieving higher social recognition and admiration.",
                "On the other hand, there are multiple other ways to incentivize employees to work hard without financial involvement. The first motivation comes in the form of healthy competition between colleagues. In a community where workers are challenged against one another to deliver the best results, it will create a drive to work harder. This should be noted, though, that this healthy competitive attitude can turn into aggressive workplace politics if not supervised. Another motivation is when employees feel that they are serving a greater purpose in doing their jobs. For example, doctors and nurses work harder than in any other profession because they feel they have the responsibility to save lives.",
                "In conclusion, the promise of earning ample money motivates employees to work hard in various ways. However, many other incentives also make workers more diligent including job purposes and favorable competition among workers."

                "The fact that sporting events have become a fertile ground for advertisements has become a hot topic for debate, with many arguing that this trend affects the sports industry negatively. From my perspective, I partly disagree with the statement.",
                "To begin with, sports events being used as a platform for promotion can offer both the events and the sports team tremendous benefits. Firstly, advertising can help cover the event planning costs and make the events more accessible. Internationally-acclaimed sporting competitions can cost the host countries an astronomical amount of money that without sponsorships from large corporations, would not be paid off unless the entrance ticket is high-priced. This would drive fans away and hurt the event\u2019s profit. For example, the 2021 Tokyo Olympics game is reported to have generated 2.25 billion US dollars in advertising revenue, which is almost 20 percent of the hosting cost. Secondly, advertisements can give sportsmen a better living standard, thus helping them take their mind off money problems and focus on the games. Some players even got rich thanks to product endorsements, namely Ronaldo and Messi",
                "Nevertheless, promoting products during sporting events can bring about negative consequences if the product is not ethical. As sports stars are influential figures, sports teams should be careful about what products they can endorse. To be more specific, research from Yale University in 2013 claimed that some sports sponsorships that featured junk food had increased the rate of child obesity. This is because children are impressionable, therefore, once they see famous athletes with fast food, they can have the wrong impression that this kind of food is wholesome and develop cravings for junk food.",
                "In conclusion, while I believe that using sports events as a promotion platform can be beneficial, the organizers and the sportsmen should be aware of the impact of the products they advertise."

                "However, I opine that concentrating on addressing domestic issues such as homelessness or unemployment should be an utmost urgency of any country. To begin with, financial fund from the government is regarded as a crucial means to reserve and maintain welfare schemes as well as social security. The smooth flow of how society works would create a favorable environment for job opportunities which accordingly increases the economic growth rate. Furthermore, employment chances, as a result, generate more personal budgets which people can use to afford decent shelters decreasing the homelessness rate.",

First, this policy would raise people\u2019s awareness of the frequency and length of their travels. Due to the rise in expenses, people would have to cut down on unnecessary trips. Moreover, as fuel prices soar, more sustainable mobility choices that rely less on carbon-intensive fuels, namely buses that run on biofuel, will witness a surge in demand. To illustrate, in America, since 2010, hybrid vehicles and smaller transports have had a growing market as a consequence of rising fuel prices.",
                "On the other hand, increasing fuel cost cannot tackle all environmental issues. As a matter of fact, car emissions are not the sole cause, but emissions from livestock farming and other industries are also significant contributors to pollution. To illustrate, what is surprising is that livestock accounts for 64 percent of total methane emission - a destructive gas for the ozone layer.

Therefore, those who are talented at maths can not only help businesses predict future trends and stay one step ahead of their opponents, they might be able to assist in logistics or administrative tasks as well. This is why for example why top financial institutions and technology companies, such as Goldman Sachs and Tesla, often pay premiums in order to recruit the top mathematicians from prestigious universities.",

With regard to the former, the proliferation of illegal trading would be negatively encouraged when no policy is established by the government. For instance, under no national restrictions, there will be an upsurge in the amount of marijuana imported from Portugal, where it is decriminalized, to our country due to an exceeding demand and substantial profits. From the cultural viewpoint, a strong preference for foreign products, such as food or clothes, may exert disadvantageous impacts on local culture.

                "Juveniles these days demonstrate their personal preference for different media such as books and films instead of putting emphasis on hands-on experiences when learning. While I acknowledge that there are still a certain number of people who prefer the latter, I think that it is more reasonable to widen young people\u2019s knowledge via books and movies.",
                "Those who advocate the paramount importance of real-life experiences in learning may point to its provision of practical knowledge. It goes without saying that firsthand experiences offer individuals the authentic sensation as well as a long-lasting understanding of a myriad of subjects. For example, in comparison to reading about the production of ceramics through books, participating in making them greatly enhances people\u2019s comprehension of its process, which will definitely last longer in our memory and the experience will not be ever replaced.",
                "Learning through books and movies, on the other hand, is more recommendable in terms of financial affairs and the variety of contents. With regard to the former, written form of texts and films cost much less considerable amount of money compared to the payment for hands-on experiences. A book about the history and geography of Hoi An - an ancient town in central Vietnam, for instance, is undoubtedly much more affordable compared to a journey to this breathtaking hotspot. Looking at the second idea, advancements in technology have facilitated the growth of the Internet where the proliferation of movies has been encouraged, which fosters the diversity of data that people can utilize for learning purposes. The process of obtaining new knowledge is supported by a wide range of content, which makes the attempt to gain firsthand experience become meaningless.",
                "In conclusion, although I acknowledge that the role of offering pragmatic knowledge of real-life experiences is undeniable, from my perspective, the inexpensive cost and diversified content of books and movies make them a more possible approach to widen one\u2019s horizon."

From my perspective, however, exerting discipline on parents for their children\u2019s wrongdoings is not justified as every individual is responsible for their own actions and kids are also influenced by other factors.",
                "Parents ought to primarily take accountability for their children\u2019s malpractice as they are supposed to be role models for their offspring from the early days of kids' lives. It could be true that juveniles\u2019 misbehaviors which violate the law may derive from observation of their parents. And since youngsters are acutely sensitive, they can be affected at ease. For example, if parents are offenders who cheat others for money, their children would suppose it as normal and consequently commit the same crime in possible cases in the future.",
                "Notwithstanding the aforementioned arguments, I hold the belief that punishment should not be inflicted on parents when their offsprings break the law. The first reason can be attributed to individuals\u2019 responsibility for their actions. Each person is a separate individual who has his or her own will in engaging in a myriad of activities. It is, therefore, morally wrong and may habour resentment and ill-will when people are punished for the acts that they did not perform. Another point worth mentioning is that children are influenced by not only parents but also other factors such as peers or anti-social content on the Internet. Frequent exposure to toxic friends at school or violent topics on social media, for instance, may evoke the child\u2019s irritability and temperament, which could be the potential root of crime-committing activities. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that other parties should share responsibility for children\u2019s evil deeds.",
                "In conclusion, although parents play a crucial role in setting examples for their children, I am of the opinion that it is unjustified to accuse them of their children\u2019s dirty deeds because of individual liability for their actions and other exterior influential parties."

                "It goes without saying that machine translation can bring greater benefits in terms of speed and a variety of languages. Regarding the former, it is undeniable that computer programs can translate texts much faster than human translators, making the former a much better option when the time given is limited or when only an approximate or summary translation is needed. Concerning the second advantage, artificial intelligence software is capable of translating multiple languages. A prime example of this is Google Translate, as it can instantly recognise and translate up to one hundred languages, thereby being used basically throughout the entire world.",

Some may say that the more languages individuals can master, the more chances of job promotion they may be offered. Since the world has virtually been a global village in which international trade has enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation. The proficiency in languages, thus, provides people with many employment opportunities and eventual success in life. Another benefit that is worth considering is the cultural exposure that one may have when discovering any language. Undoubtedly, language is one of the authentic reflections of its culture; thus, linguistic learning would play a pivotal role in the provision of cultural experience that electronic translators fail to deliver.",

First, fathers and mothers alike experience tension prior to, during, and after childbirth; therefore, paternity leave should be given to help them cope with a new phase in their lives. It has been scientifically proven that males can undergo couvade syndrome, in which fathers-to-be suffer from some of the similar symptoms as their pregnant partners. If these men are forced to work, their productivity could decrease and their work quality may be affected negatively. Moreover, taking care of a newborn is oftentimes a taxing phase in a woman\u2019s life; that is why having their partner share the burden of childcare will be mentally and physically beneficial to new mothers. Spouses can take turns looking after the baby, letting the other parent rest and at the same time, forming close bonds with their child.",
                "In addition, paternity leave can be financially beneficial, especially towards working mothers. In families where the woman is the main breadwinner, having the husbands stay at home to look after their children can help relieve financial stress. Additionally, paternity leave can also contribute to reducing the wage gap between males and females by empowering mothers to preserve their profession and delegating equal parenting responsibilities between the two sexes, leaving more time for women to focus on their careers. Moreover, for families in which the grandparents cannot help taking care of newborns, the parents can save a huge amount of money on nannies to support new mothers since the fathers can play that role.",
                "To conclude, fathers should have the right to take time off work after their children are born. This is because paternity leave will help new parents relieve stress, both mentally and financially."

Moreover, fees for online performances are significantly lower than for live ones, meaning that more people will get to see shows without having to pay handsomely.

For example, most multinational companies now are led by older managers, such as LVMH, which is still guided by 73-year-old Bernard Arnault.

The four fundamentals of a brand\u2019s success are: product, price, place, and promotion. If a service is overpriced or lacking in quality or not widely available, then despite heavy promotional efforts, that product will not sell well in the market. A prime example is the case of McDonald\u2019s in Vietnam. Despite its rather successful advertisements when it first appeared, after a few years, the brand\u2019s penetration in the Southeast Asia country is considered a flop. McDonald\u2019s unsuccessful venture could be attributed to its dishes, which are costly and unsuitable to the local\u2019s taste.",
                "On the other hand, I believe that advertisements have an immeasurable power of impact on shoppers. First, advertisements can educate and guide first-time consumers. To be more specific, in case a buyer has never purchased a product before, the first source of information she has is from advertisements. Thus, while shopping for the product, the topmost name on her mind would be the one with the most frequent promotions. Secondly, advertising can help shift people\u2019s perception of a brand. Consumers, after watching a promotional video over and over again, will start to memorize the product\u2019s benefits subconsciously and associate the product with said advantages. To exemplify, Louis Vuitton launched a collaboration - an advertisement effort - with Supreme in order to appeal to millennials. The partnership was a success as the famed fashion house managed to gain popularity among the demographic whose favor all brands are competing for.",

                "With technological advancements come numerous benefits, one of which being the decrease in crime rate. In my opinion, technology supports law enforcers in restraining and solving criminal activities.",
                "First and foremost, nowadays, high-tech gears and programs have helped solve cases faster and more accurately. In case of milder offenses, such as burglary, CCTV cameras can help the police identify the lawbreaker through his captured images, whereas in the past, law enforcers had to rely on memory portraits from witnesses, which could often be inaccurate. For serious felonies, technological advances play an important role in bringing justice to the victims. To illustrate, in Texas, a 35-year-old cold case has just been solved using DNA technology. The 1986 murder was thought to be hopeless as the technology back then did not allow for DNA analysis, yet three decades later, justice was found thanks to innovations in crime science.",
                "Another advantage of technological developments is its ability to prevent crimes. What this means is that through the use of technology, crime attempts can be deterred. For example, released convicts will usually be forced to wear a GPS tracking device and be put on a watchlist. Thanks to this, criminals will have to rethink their plans of recidivism as they could be busted easily and sent to jail. Compared to the old days, those who have done their sentences were free to do whatever they wanted, leading to high recidivism rates.",
                "To conclude, with the power in curbing potential criminal activities and crime-solving, the reduction of crimes can be attributed to technological developments."

                "Throughout the course of history, it has been well-proven that laws have bound humans as a community. Laws could be understood as a set of social guidelines that set each person\u2019s responsibility. One case in point are regulations about food safety. At the state and local level, restaurants must follow rules on sanitary food storage and preparation to ensure diner\u2019s safety. At a national level, production plants should be examined by governmental agencies to guarantee that food at markets will be of top quality. Thanks to food safety regulations, the relationship between consumers and service providers will be balanced and indisputable.",
                "Moreover, rules and regulations ensure equality for people of all social stratas. When there are no laws, humans can freely do as they please, thus, resulting in discrimination between different classes. That the rich would be favored while the poor would be opposed, and the gap between the well-off and the less fortunate would widen is likely to happen. For example, a famous case of laxed law and order, leading to double standards is the scandal of the Red Bull heir, who was charged with a hit and run but has managed to escape retribution for years. If the criminal was an everyday citizen, he would now be serving his sentence. Thailand\u2019s public was angered and have been demanding for the law to be enforced.",
                "In conclusion, when there are no laws and rules, the society would fall into chaos and some of its fundamentals, such as equality, could not be achieved. Therefore, humans should put these founding pillars as our top priorities instead of acting on our own wills."

                "On the one hand, advocates of equal treatment for underaged and adult lawbreakers have grounds to believe that this notion can have positive results. First, more young criminals would emerge if they are pardoned for their wrongdoings due to their age. Some retributions are too light for the seriousness of the felonies committed, hence, cannot deter youngsters from breaking the law. Moreover, giving young offenders lighter sentences is unjust for the victims and their families, as some felonies are too vile for punishments such as being sent to prison. One case in point is in Vietnam, 2017, a robber killed a family of 4, including the parents and their young children. Usually, this man would have been sentenced to death, yet he only got sentenced to 18 years in prison. The fact that he escaped just punishment because he was a few months underaged angered the public for an extended period of time.",
                "On the other hand, I strongly believe that juvenile delinquents should not receive retributions similar to that for adults. To start with, children do not have the moral capacity and thorough understanding of the world as grown-ups. Therefore, they cannot fully comprehend the weight of their wrongdoings or even the sentences. Some young offenders commit crimes without knowing that it is an offense. Thus, giving these criminals leeway and an opportunity to rehabilitate and contributing to society is more humane. Furthermore, adolescents are easily affected by different factors, as compared to adults. Grown-ups have the ability to stop themselves but younger ones, once instigated, may act on impulse and cause regrets.",
                "To conclude, while it is undeniable that inflicting fitting penalties for criminals is important to upholding society\u2019s stability and values, I am of the opinion that young lawbreakers should be tried differently in court from adult offenders."

Nowadays, thanks to the internet, any kind of knowledge is available within just a click of a mouse. Furthermore, students these days can save their assignments on the internet, making it more convenient to share with their classmates for peer review sessions or with their teachers. An example of this is Google Classroom, which can act as a virtual classroom where students can submit assignments and converse with their professors.",

First, this policy would raise people\u2019s awareness on the frequency and length of their travels. Due to the rise in expenses, people would have to cut down on unnecessary trips. Moreover, as fuel prices soar, more sustainable mobility choices that rely less on carbon-intensive fuels, namely buses that run on biofuel, will witness a surge in demand. To illustrate, in America, since 2010, hybrid vehicles and smaller transports have had a growing market as a consequence of rising fuel prices.",
                "On the other hand, increasing fuel cost cannot tackle all environmental issues. As a matter of fact, car emissions are not the sole cause, but emissions from livestock farming and other industries are also significant contributors to pollution. To illustrate, what is surprising is that livestock accounts for 64 percent of total methane emission - a destructive gas for the ozone layer. Hence, providing individuals and businesses with an incentive to protect the environment would be more effective. For example, the government can apply a lower tax on companies which leave less impact on its surroundings. In this way, enterprises will proactively find ways to reduce their carbon footprint.\u00a0",

Benefits and funds allocated to different areas in a country will vary depending on their economic and political importance. That is why in Vietnam, provinces like Hai Phong are less developed than Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi, thus locals of Hai Phong do not have the chance to experience top-notch facilities as in big cities. Nevertheless, Hai Phong is home to various factories of well-known brands. If these businesses help pay for the construction of sports and recreational facilities in the province, Hai Phong\u2019s citizens would have equal quality of life as Hanoians. Since the government cannot invest uniformly throughout a country, large enterprises building local facilities would be a great help in improving the country\u2019s social welfare.\u00a0",
                "Moreover, providing sports and social facilities for the local community is a way for businesses to fulfill their corporate social responsibility. As a matter of fact, all corporations are bound to give back to the community in one way or another. However, in comparison to doing charities or organizing marathons, providing the community with sports and social facilities would leave a more lasting impact and on a much larger scale.

Firstly, this can help solve the issue of the declining workforce in many countries with an aging population. By having capable elderly employees, the society is supplied with an additional source of knowledgeable workers. Secondly, older people who continue working can save the government a part of the monthly subsidy for retirees, which can be allocated to build and improve the country\u2019s infrastructure. Retirement benefits vary from country to country but a payment every month for retired workingmen is a common theme. By decreasing the number of elders in the community, the government can cut a huge amount of expenses and this sum can be allocated to the country\u2019s social welfare.",

                "To begin with, males being more aggressive than females can be attributed to evolution. Since the dawn of civilization, males have been hunters and women have been gatherers. While men hunted for food and protected the tribes from danger, women took on more domestic tasks and cared for infants and those that were weak. As a result, males developed to be more combative in order to fight off predators or enemies, and females grew to be more nurturing. Overtime, these became inherited traits for both genders in later generations. To exemplify, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 pointed out that women accounted for merely 2.5 percent of the highest paid executives.  What caused this includes a lack of female leaders in the most competitive positions, among other reasons.",
                "Moreover, women naturally have less desire for competition than men due to their roles in the patriarchal society. Throughout the course of human history, patriarchy has been dominating. In former times, women were forced to take a back seat in most aspects. These days, this practice is deprecated, yet taboos towards competitive women still exist. For example, at the workplace, if a woman is openly ambitious, her actions are likely to be frowned upon. As a result, in nature, women are less confident than men in pursuing their goals and often shy away from competition as they are convinced that their achievements are undesirable and that they have less chance of winning.",

                "First, economic wealth is only a part of life satisfaction, therefore, it can only please people to an extent. From my point of view, there is a limitation of material possessions that a person could hoard. Most people only need a roof over their head, food and money that are used to pay for other necessities. Therefore, once these needs are fulfilled, a surplus of other properties is no longer desirable. Additionally, a person\u2019s satisfaction is not made of economic wealth alone but also of their well-being and relationships. To be more specific, a person could be the richest, yet if he were to suffer from a prolonged illness, he would not achieve true satisfaction.",
                "On the other hand, I believe that however prosperous a country is, additional economic growth would always appease its citizens. There are aspects that only a nation\u2019s monetary reserve can solve, thus, the larger the reserve becomes, the more problems it can tackle. Take road infrastructure for example, even if a person drives the most expensive car but the road is bumpy, he would not be able to fully enjoy the experience. In these cases, a country\u2019s economic wealth is important since more money equals better infrastructure. Furthermore, an abundance of possessions will lead to advancements in technology and healthcare. These in turn will benefit its citizens beyond materialistic satisfaction.",

                "Nonetheless, it might conversely be argued that some richer countries should still have some responsibility to assist poorer and weaker governments who cannot govern themselves. This could produce goodwill between countries and promote international cooperation. Furthermore, by helping countries that cannot effectively govern, this reduces the possibility that there will be refugees as a result of political instability or war. For instance, the reason why aid is given to developing countries in South America by the United States is to make the countries more stable and to reduce immigration into the latter country.",
                "Overall, I argue that it is true that in most cases, governments should only focus on its people since spreading its resources to other nations would be ineffective and wasteful, it should be said that it can sometimes be in their interest to support those from other countries in order to ensure cooperation and stability."

                "First, because human self-discipline is often unreliable, suitable punishments from the government are necessary. To be more specific, if people are left to protect the environment of their own volition, efforts may vary between different communities since having an equal understanding of our habitat\u2019s importance throughout the community is impossible. For example, all tourist attractions nowadays have to impose a fine on those who litter, because once such a rule is not in effect, all sites will be filled with trash left behind by ignorant tourists. In Ha Long Bay, Vietnam, due to a lack of guards, the world-renowned heritage site is blighted with trash floating on the water surface.",
                "Another point is that, through educational efforts, governments holding people accountable for their actions in the local environment can help raise awareness effectively. Most people nowadays have a fear of missing out so once a green lifestyle is advocated strongly, it will soon spread widely. Take the inox straw trend for example, the movement started by a group of environmentalists was picked up by large beverage companies and has now become one of the most profitable businesses the world over. The same effect may not be achieved if the movement was a policy implemented by the government. Furthermore, initiatives can be taken to prompt individuals to make small changes such as reducing the frequency of their travels, which can help reduce the overall carbon footprint.",
                "To sum up, the government making people responsible towards their own environment is indisputable. By means of educational campaigns and suitable punishments, more meaningful changes can be made from the individual's side."

                "First of all, humans are partly responsible for various disappearances of animal species. While many wild beasts went extinct from natural causes, a greater proportion of species are on the verge of extinction or no longer extant as a result of human activities. Mass deforestation to build infrastructure or for timber harvesting has cost wild animals their living habitats, leading to food sources depletion and eventually, death. To illustrate, Australia's recent wildfires have pushed around 100 species closer to extinction. Hunting is another notorious cause for the dwindling of animals\u2019 population as many species such as rhinos or elephants are hunted for their body parts. For example, the African Black Rhinos are no longer in existence for being hunted for their horns.",
                "Another point is that preventing animals from being extinct is critical to our ecosystem. The loss of animal species could disrupt our ecosystem\u2019s balance. Since all living organisms\u2019 lives in a habitat are interrelated, once a species succumbs to extinction, other animals that depend on it will be affected and eventually disappear. This will lead to the lack of diversity and can also cause potential damage to our economy. For example, in 2013, the sunflower starfish in Northern California declined in number due to a disease, thus causing its prey - the purple sea urchins to flourish. This sudden proliferation has damaged the red urchins\u2019 population and also exhausted a great source of sushi, which resulted in a slump in the area\u2019s economy.",
                "To summarize, the process of animal extinction has been escalated by human activities such as hunting and deforestation. This will have grave consequences on both our ecosystem and our economics, thus it is urgent that we take action to protect all animal species."

From my point of view, I side with the view that international tourism helps promote peace rather than dispute between nations.",
                "To start with, international travel allows interracial understanding and friendship between nations to flourish. By experiencing life in other parts of the world and taking a closer look into the locals\u2019 mindset through their cuisines and traditions, foreigners can respect and sympathize with the natives more. Furthermore, most hate starts from fear of the unknown. When people do not understand another race, they start to believe in false preconceptions, thus shunning people who do not share the same root with them. Through international tourism, this bias can be erased since people are given a glimpse into other cultures and it can help correct existing prejudices.",
                "On the other hand, it is unfortunate that international travel, if done with ignorance, can create disputes between people from different countries. Every country the world over has their own customs and superstitions, therefore it is important to learn what the locals believe in. If a traveler does not conduct any research then it is very likely that the traveler can unintentionally offend the local values, thus causing conflicts to arise. Take the \u201cOK\u201d sign as an example, it is one of the most common gestures throughout the world, yet its meaning varies between nations. While in America, the \u201cOK\u201d sign equals something positive and good, in Iran, it is an insult.",

Nevertheless, careless travelers may bring about disputes if they are not proactive in learning the culture of their destination."

                "On the one hand, it is undeniable that punishments are imperative in some instances. First, punishments are efficacious in upholding the legal system. By instilling fear of retribution in potential criminals, punishments help dissuade wrongdoings, thus ensuring security for the society. Secondly, punishments are just desserts for re-offenders. This is because they were well-aware of the consequences of their crimes, yet they decided to fall back into old habits. For these recidivists, education alone would be insufficient while stronger punitive measures should be imposed.",
                "On the other hand, diverting first-time and minor offenders from prosecution has some positives in preventing crimes. Firstly, diversion will save legal enforcers time and effort. Sometimes, trivial cases such as shoplifting will get low-level penalties even if they are brought to court. Therefore, by giving out notices for minor offences, the police can allot more time for more serious crimes. Furthermore, rehabilitative measures can have positive impacts on reducing crime rates. Sometimes, people who break laws are unintentional, in these cases, proper education is appropriate. For instance, a  research conducted in London in 2015 has proven that those cautioned were 50 percent less likely to reoffend as compared to those who were fined by a court. Moreover, warnings give young adults a greater chance to grow out of crime, since having a clean record will open them up to many job opportunities instead of resorting to crime to make a living.",

These celebrities may achieve fame and wealth from their parents, partners, families, or from being scandalous. This can mislead youngsters to believe that success can be achieved through unconventional means and give them a twisted perspective on life\u2019s values.

                "To begin with, sports events being used as a platform for promotion can offer both the events and the sports team tremendous benefits. Firstly, advertising can help cover the event planning costs and make the events more accessible. Internationally-acclaimed sporting competitions can cost the host countries an astronomical amount of money that without sponsorships from large corporations, would not be paid off unless the entrance ticket is high-priced. This would drive fans away and hurt the event\u2019s profit. For example, the 2021 Tokyo Olympics game is reported to have generated 2.25 billion US dollars in advertising revenue, which is almost 20 percent of the hosting cost. Secondly, advertisements can give sportsmen a better living standard, thus helping them take their mind off money problems and focus on the games. Some players even got rich thanks to product endorsements, namely Ronaldo and Messi",
                "Nevertheless, promoting products during sporting events can bring about negative consequences if the product is not ethical. As sports stars are influential figures, sports teams should be careful about what products they can endorse. To be more specific, research from Yale University in 2013 claimed that some sports sponsorships that featured junk food had increased the rate of child obesity. This is because children are impressionable, therefore, once they see famous athletes with fast food, they can have the wrong impression that this kind of food is wholesome and develop cravings for junk food.",
                "In conclusion, while I believe that using sports events as a promotion platform can be beneficial, the organizers and the sportsmen should be aware of the impact of the products they advertise."

Firstly, the government has the budget from national taxes that can support scientists and researchers. Thus, the company in charge would receive money to complete their work without worrying about the depletion of resources.

Firstly, non-governmental companies usually pay a huge amount of money for their staff; this helps them attract more talented and skillful scientists to work for them. As a result, scientific studies and papers conducted by these organizations are likely to be more accurate. Secondly, unlike the authority that has many aspects to take care of, independent firms often concentrate on only one to two fields, which helps to yield auspicious results.

For example, raising the driving age from 18 to 21 means tens of thousands of people will not be able to drive. As a result, more buses, taxis, and other urban public transport means must be put into use, or parents will have to continue driving their children around.

Firstly, by lifting the minimum driving age, driving schools will have more time to educate young adults on road safety, leading to future generations driving more carefully. For example, currently, if you want to get a driving license, most people do not attend a driving school. They only need to take a quiz and a driving test. That certainly can be improved.

                "Today, more and more parents are sending their kids to study abroad, leading to the question of whether study-abroad students are beneficial to their home country. Although I strongly agree that there are benefits to the home country, I also think there are downsides.",
                "There are two main reasons why I think the government should welcome students who choose to pursue education in another country. Firstly, it is a fact that there are lots of prestigious educational institutions around the world that Vietnamese students can attend. This means that these students can grow to their fullest potentials, then return to Vietnam with this knowledge and help to develop the country in multiple aspects. Secondly, going abroad will help equip students with new perspectives and lifestyles, which benefits the home country. For example, students who come back from the US will usually be more open-minded and proactive in their workplace. As a result, they will gradually change the work culture for the better.",
                "However, that is not to say that the home country would always benefit from study-abroad students. The first reason is that there is an alarming portion of students who do not return home after being abroad. Many reasons can explain this phenomenon, such as the home country does not offer a stable enough career prospect, or that the pay is not high enough, but one thing for sure is that this leads to brain drain. The second reason is that students can be out of touch with the social scene in their home country after studying abroad. As a result, fresh graduates may find it difficult to blend in at work. For example, most abroad students are ignorant of social movements happening in their home countries and often are not engaged in conversations at work with these topics.",
                "In conclusion, I strongly agree that the benefits that study-abroad students bring to their home country are undeniable. However, I do not think studying abroad is suitable for anyone, and that we should have some policies to ensure that these students will be more likely to return after graduating."

In this essay, I seek to argue that I overall disagree with this sentiment, since advertising can create differentiation from other products or promote certain lifestyles, which in the end increases products\u2019 attractiveness to consumers.",
                "On the one hand, it could be argued that advertising might not be necessary for certain special products as word of mouth might be enough to increase its sales, given that it fulfills customer needs. Those who have tried a unique product and are satisfied with it might voluntarily recommend it to their friends and colleagues. This is, for instance, how many companies operating in niche markets operate, as their consumer base is too small for mass advertising campaigns to be effective. Furthermore, it could also be said that in the internet age, potential consumers can simply search the internet for products that are congruent with their needs. For example, restaurants in a small area might not need to advertise to local inhabitants, since they can simply search on Google Maps and find the restaurants themselves.",
                "On the other hand, one might contend that advertising is still necessary beyond showcasing the functionality of a product. In markets where there are many different brands for the same type of item, advertising can be the element which can help a customer make their final decision. For instance, although Coca Cola and Pepsi are functionally quite similar (i.e. they are both soft drinks), both brands still spend billions on advertising a year in order to make themselves seem unique. In addition, advertising could also be useful in associating a product with a certain lifestyle. For example, advertisements by perfume brands such as Hugo Boss often depict a luxurious way of living that can be obtained upon buying their product - this means that the consumer is buying the product not only for its functional value but the perception around it.",
                "In conclusion, I argue that while for some small companies, advertising would be an unnecessary financial burden since their customer base is small enough that this would not be necessary. Nonetheless, for most products which caters to a larger audience, I believe that it needs to not only be useful to consumers but also create a certain image, and this is why advertising would still be crucial for its success."

                "There are many reasons why I believe that living in the city is more beneficial. Firstly, metropolitan areas are job hubs for a wide variety of industries, which is why young professionals migrate here. For example, Ho Chi Minh City has many multinational companies in fields ranging from technology to marketing with great demands for workers. Secondly, the urban lifestyle offers multiple entertainment options for young adults and educational facilities for their children. Big cities usually host an extensive range of public events, like festivals, concerts, exhibitions, or sports events, where couples can go on their weekends. Their children would also benefit from a diverse education provided by many English institutions, sports clubs, and art centers.",
                "However, that is not to say that life in the countryside is at a disadvantage. Firstly, it is apparent that pollution issues are drastically better in the suburbs and rural areas. For example, because there are not as many vehicles in the countryside, there are fewer exhaust fumes, which leads to significantly cleaner air. Fewer factories also mean water and soil contamination problems are better. Secondly, a lower living cost is also why many still want to stay in the suburbs. Housing prices in the suburbs are tremendously less than those in the cities, and average rents have the same trend. Also, because most produce comes from the countryside, if one eats locally, the grocery cost is reduced.",

                "I disagree with the statement because international travels foster the tourism industry of Vietnam. For example, for many tourist attractions, local people rely heavily on tourism to make their living. Foreign tourists are typically more generous as they spend more on food, souvenirs, and activities like canoeing or zip-lining. Another reason why I disagree is that, because of foreign travelers, more restoration of Vietnamese culture gets carried out. Foreign tourists are more interested in traditional festivals, clothes, and buildings than domestic ones. By encouraging foreigners to visit Vietnam, we have the incentives to preserve our traditions, especially when foreigners appreciate them.",
                "However, I can understand why some people have a negative attitude towards foreign tourists. The first reason is that foreigners sometimes can have little respect for the environment of the country they traveled to. It can be seen, usually, after vacations, that visitors from some countries would typically litter all over the beaches, like Vung Tau or Nha Trang. The second reason is that the greater the influx of international tourists, the less domestic tourists can enjoy themselves. For example, Hoi An is always packed with tourists from South Korea and China all year round, making it extremely difficult for domestic tourists to enjoy any activities here. This problem is considered the tradeoff between prioritizing international or domestic tourists.",

Therefore, those who are talented at maths can not only help businesses predict future trends and stay one step ahead of their opponents, they might be able to assist in logistics or administrative tasks as well. This is why for example why top financial institutions and technology companies, such as Goldman Sachs and Tesla, often pay premiums in order to recruit the top mathematicians from prestigious universities.",

Secondly, I believe parents should not prevent children from playing video games as these games can serve as career inspirations.

However, there is only so much that innate talent can do for you if hard work is not present. For example, students who are extremely bright kids score poorly on the college entrance exam or do not contribute to anything significant in their careers. Moreover, many people think luck plays a role in helping people build their connections.

These skills are hard to train in any other way aside from gaming. The second benefit is that playing video games is a great way for gamers to discover whether or not they want to pursue a career in game design. Teenagers can become interested in writing the storyline, designing the costume, or tweaking the graphics when playing games.",
                "In conclusion, although there are some drawbacks of playing video games excessively, I think that video games are a great way to train multiple skills at once while serving as a way for people to explore their interests in game design. I strongly disagree with the statement that games are detrimental to players."

I agree with this view, and believe that although society should allow individuals a level of autonomy, an effective legal system is necessary for a well functioning society, and ensure the safety of the general population.",
                "On the one hand, I believe that a level of autonomy is necessary for a society to flourish. Individual freedom allows the whole of society to move forward - by each person doing what he or she wants to a certain extent (so long as it does not harm others), society can benefit from greater creativity and flexibility. Furthermore, this would also improve the state of civil society, since individuals would be able to debate one another on issues that concern their common governance, and as such make place for a healthier democracy. This is for example, the case in Western Europe, where a more individualist societal set up has created the longest surviving democracies and richest countries in the world.",
                "On the other hand, one could also rightly point that no man exists as an island, and that individuals are connected within a society through a set of laws. These rules not only ensure that individuals do not exploit one another, it also sets the expectations for societal interactions - this standardization of behaviour allows people to treat each other with a degree of similarity and upholds societal stability, which could be said to be sorely lacking from an archaic society. For instance, in areas of war, where societal trust has broken down, we can see that individuals are much more skeptical of one another.",

In my opinion, teaching children to play musical instruments should not be superimposed, and that parents should develop the skills that most align with a child\u2019s interest.",
                "One side of the argument is that learning how to play a musical instrument from an earlier age could unlock more doors for children in the future. In today\u2019s competitive world, universities are increasingly looking at not only academic abilities but also candidates\u2019 extracurricular activities in order to assess their applications. As such, being able to fluently play a musical instrument would be a great addition to a child\u2019s future CV and allow them access to better opportunities. For instance, statistics for schools like Harvard University show that while every person applying would be academically talented, what differentiates successful applicants are things such as musical and sports achievements.",
                "On the other hand, forcing children to learn a musical instrument might be a waste of time if they do not truly enjoy it. This is because not only would the child not pursue a musical interest later in life, but making the investment to teach them an instrument be in vain, there is also an opportunity cost to not teaching them something else they are interested in. All individuals can be said to be different, and not everyone can (or want to) become a musician.

Human conceptual and linguistic capabilities point to a high level of inquisitiveness and self expression, and as such, space travel could be a potential avenue for expressing these drives. This is why, for instance, despite it not necessarily being profitable, organisations such as NASA continue to spend billions of dollars a year in helping to develop space travel. Thus, if we are able to reduce costs enough for people to live on Mars, this will allow a new generation of humans to learn more about the universe and our place within it.",

These documentaries are often accurate and delivered with great quality, helping the audience understand the foreign cultures better. For example, Netflix recently has released a popular series depicting street food worldwide. Moreover, this option is suitable for those who have yet to be capable of international flights or people who only want a slight experience of multiple countries. For example, if a student is writing a paper on the difference between Asian cultures, he or she has to research online instead of traveling to said countries.",

                "On the other hand, one could argue that due to the urgency and universality of today\u2019s problems, there must be international solutions. Over the last 50 years, it is clear that economies have become ever more interconnected, and the issue of one country can quickly become that of another. For example, the pollution created by many first world countries has been shown to result in climate change, creating swathes of economic refugees that in turn have to flee to first world countries. Therefore, it is crucial that a compromise be made by all national actors in order to prevent threats to both poor and rich countries.\ufeff",
                "In conclusion, I believe that while there is evidence that national politics is more effective than international cooperation, society should nonetheless strive towards the latter, due to the widespread and serious issues humanity faces today."

                "However, I do understand why university students should spend time studying. Firstly, working part-time jobs or participating in extracurricular activities can distract them from their studies. These activities sound more attractive than studying because there are rewards for them, such as money, connections, or friends. As a result, there have been cases where students eventually fail classes because of these activities.  Another reason is that universities often promote team orientation by encouraging collective efforts. If students allocate too much time to peripheral activities, they would barely have time to squeeze a group meeting into their schedule, resulting in project failure.",
                "Despite these challenges, I still think university students should engage in other activities rather than just studying. As university students, they are becoming young professionals, so working either part-time jobs or internships means preparation for the workplace. Working also provides them financial independence from their family, which lessens their burden. Moreover, by participating in extracurricular activities, students can have a better understanding of what is going on in society. For example, many universities have debate clubs that discuss both international and domestic socio-political issues. Students can gain crucial insights into society through these.",

As a result, young workers tend to burn out quite early before switching jobs to something more enjoyable.

Some of the most beautiful and long-lasting friendships and romantic relationships stem from middle or high school, for example.

People who do not have homes are more likely to suffer from the anxiety of having to pay monthly rent, while homeless people would also be unable to get jobs. This is because for the former group, owning a house as a way of retiring is out of the question, while for the latter, most companies do not hire people who do not have a house. Therefore, these people might turn to crime or other antisocial activities in order to survive. Thus, there are large sections of society that can be utilised, but are denied opportunities due to the housing crisis.",

While people might hold that this should be done by the private sector, I contend conversely that this would simply lead to individuals buying up houses and driving up housing shortages again. Therefore, the government should use taxpayer\u2019s money to provide good and affordable housing. An example where this is already done is in Austria and Singapore, where citizens are virtually guaranteed a house by the government, with those who have money paying for private accomodation if they want.",

Many great writers have confirmed that the secret to better writing is via extensive pursuing. Learning about literature also helps with verbal communication, as students can pick up slang from a novel to use in real life. Also, there are many characters in famous Vietnamese works used to refer to certain qualities, such as using Hoan Thu to represent a jealous person.",

Because literature reflects peoples' lives in a certain region during a certain period, much is revealed through studying novels and poems.

In order to display their masculinity, and To keep up an image of a patriarchal society, male leaders might act tough in order to gather the support of the populace. Female leaders, on the other hand, might display more sympathetic and diplomatic gestures and are less likely to resort to violence if disputes are to arise. In this way, they can garner public support by providing for their needs and wants in a more peaceful manner.",

A drive to secure resources is universal, and it could be argued that women might even be more observant in these sorts of situations to know when to wage war. As such, simply changing what sex a leader is will not lead to a safer world - rather, it is important to ensure that there are avenues of cross-country collaboration.",

Firstly, this tax can encourage not just consumers, but also processed food industries and restaurants to change their habits. For example, since some US states imposed a sugar tax, many coffee and milk tea shops have offered a zero-sugar option at a discounted price. Secondly, I believe this junk food tax is sufficient to cover the additional costs to the health insurance fund. If more people eat junk food, they are likely to develop obese-related illnesses, a burden to national medical coverage. As a result, if people choose to eat unhealthily, they should pay extra to cover their future medical bills, which are partly subsidized by the government.",
                "However, this junk food tax alone does not guarantee significant changes in people\u2019s awareness. Firstly, without developing an alternative, there is still a lack of motivation to change their diet. For example, many people admit they would not mind a minimal increase in price if junk food is still cheaper than healthier alternatives. Secondly, and more importantly, this junk food tax serves as discrimination against the poor. Most fast-food consumers, at least in developed countries, are underprivileged people. Thus, taxing them would mean widening the gap between the rich and the poor. When the poor become even poorer, they are more likely to turn to junk food, as it is cheap and is a sufficient source of energy. As a result, this becomes an endless cycle.",

I disagree with this sentiment, however, since there is not much evidence to the idea that books are inherently more beneficial to children, and that they should be given both mediums in order to aid their developmental processes.",
                "On one hand, child psychologists now believe that there may be far more benefits to playing video games which could be beneficial to their long-term development. Games are famous for improving spatial awareness and logic amongst younger children and can also serve to teach morality on a far better level than many books, for they purposely place the player in ethical scenarios with long-term consequences. For example, games such as Undertale are revered for their capabilities in teaching hard-hitting moral philosophy in a hands-on, a proactive approach that teaches the player the consequences of their actions.",
                "On the other hand, reading books is the only real way of improving literacy, which is essential for young children if they want to have a well-paying job in the future. Child literacy is often used as a measure to compare the educational performance of different countries, as a literate population can better absorb instructions needed to carry out their future professions. Therefore, improving a child's ability to read in the home through stories can be an effective way to improve their chances of financial success in the future.",
                "Overall I believe that while the traditional book is still hugely beneficial to children, TV, and video games have been shown to contribute to some aspects of their ability as well. As such, I believe that both should be consumed by the younger generations in moderation."

For example, vaccines have helped prevent multiple painful and deadly diseases like mumps or measles. Efforts to mandate education have also been successful, resulting in an extremely high literacy rate in Vietnam. Secondly, other social aspects of modern life are better than ever. For example, women and homosexual\u2019s rights are protected by laws, and people are welcome to express themselves more in public. Moreover, many people nowadays can connect with friends and family members through the Internet, making long-distance relationships more robust.",
                "However, it is also worth noticing that modern society is littered with many problems the older one did not face. Firstly, it is evident that rising rates of mental health problems are the biggest issue right now. Because people are stressed out at work and school, their mental state is also fragile. As a result, suicide and divorce rates are comparably higher currently than in the past. Secondly, the current generation is facing adverse effects of pollution and climate change more rapidly. The notion of having clean air while living in urban areas is now something of the past, while plastic wastes continue to kill marine animals. Climate change is also more apparent as natural disasters keep getting worse each year, affecting millions of people.",

Most museums nowadays offer a wider variety of information than that on the Internet. For example, museums have more exhibits, simply because some do not have the right to be posted online. Moreover, many exhibitions, especially cultural ones, use a combination of audio, lighting, or even scents to introduce the subject. Also, museum collections are carefully curated, which is not a feature found online. Curators work tirelessly to acquire and sort exhibits to present culture or a historical period as objectively and scientifically accurate as possible. All of these factors are mostly not available online, which is why museums are necessary.",
                "The second reason why the Internet cannot replace museums is that its information is not sufficient. A major problem with information online is that, unless it is posted on an academic or government-affiliated website, it is largely unverifiable. As a result, readers cannot grasp the full picture of the topic presented. Another problem with only relying on information online is that researching online requires people to first think of the subject. Few people do that. On the other hand, visiting museums can teach people things they might not expect. For example, many US tourists reportedly said that they surprisingly felt a need to review their understanding of the Vietnam War after they visited the US War Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. Without going to that museum, they might never think about such a topic for the rest of their lives.",

Because they are incapable of making responsible fiscal decisions, marketing to this demographic means exploiting their inability to make rational choices for financial gain.

                "Firstly, imprisonment is not an ideal system of managing crime because it fundamentally fails at one crucial task i.e. instilling a code of morality, and therefore does not solve the problem of crime in the long term. What is necessary, ultimately, is to teach people what is right or wrong without the need for punishment; this way, less resources need to be spent on policing people, for individuals can police themselves. Focusing on a good education is how countries such as Sweden, despite relatively tame penalties for legal offences, have one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world.",
                "Secondly, there are large socio-economic factors that go into crime, and punishment does not help to alleviate them. It is no mistake that most criminals come from low income families with low social mobility, and due to a lack of economic opportunities, many people within this lower strata of society have no choice but to turn to crime. As such, harsh punishment might simply be counterproductive. In the United States, for example, harsh punishment has not led to a decrease in crime, but has resulted in a fifty percent recidivism rate, among the highest in the world.",

However, these are all the raw feelings that the artists want to share for the audience to sympathize with them, and I think this should be the chief function of music.

This notion is especially ubiquitous in Western music, where artists have more freedom to express their views and beliefs with little censorship. It is a fact that political and social issues can spark strong feelings, and music is a way to deliver those feelings to the general public. This of course will put the listeners in an uncomfortable position because most Vietnamese still hesitate to talk openly about social issues.

Another benefit of consuming more GM foods is that they require fewer pesticides, contrary to popular belief. Because scientists design GM foods to be resistant to common pests, farmers do not need to spray pesticides as regularly as they would growing traditional crops.",

Because these crops are known to be resistant to pests, it could lead to the eradication of pest species. As a result, this can disrupt the ecosystem\u2019s balance. The second concern is that, due to GM crops\u2019 high efficiency and rapid growth, they can easily become an invasive species with unhealthy farming practices.

                "There could be said to be an increasing number of individuals who are becoming obese. Recent policy decisions have proposed that a price hike on fattening foods be implemented in order to dissuade people from consuming them and thereby curbing the obesity epidemic. I personally think that while this measure might help, it would not be nearly as effective as other measures such as portion control.",
                "Whilst there is no doubt in my mind that making fattening sugary foods more expensive would certainly curb the rise in obesity, it is still uncertain that it would necessarily be as effective as we might expect due to the price inelasticity of fast food products. Some might state the law of supply and demand as a reason why we might expect sugary food consumption to decrease when prices rise, but behavioral economics might propose that people would be more than eager to hand over more money for the fattening foods that they enjoy. This is why other addictive substances such as cigarettes, for example, have also been shown to be somewhat immune to price increases.",
                "Furthermore, a larger issue may actually be portion control, as having larger portions in each meal could actually encourage people to eat more. Particularly in fast food chains, food portions are exorbitantly large leading to each meal being calorically higher than normal meals. If portions are decreased for every meal, even if the price is lowered, it could lead to people consuming less calories per meal and thus becoming less obese. Studies have shown that by making bowls smaller, for example, individuals also consume less food. If governments apply this method to fast food restaurants, it could potentially decrease obesity rates more effectively than price hikes could.",
                "Overall, I argue that whilst increasing the price of fattening foods might help to a degree, I argue that other options such as portion control might be more effective."

Because film and video records let the audience get an understanding of past lives through their judgment, it is more impressive. Also, film and video records can hardly exaggerate past events, so the audience will have a more legitimate understanding. Another reason why many people agree is the personal aspect of learning through past videos. For example, if written documents are mainly by scholars, which tend to be objective, films are often based on anecdotes. This aspect makes the audience find the content portrayed more relatable to them when there is a story.",
                "However, I also understand that many people would opt for written documents when learning about the past. Written documents are more easily accessible and are faster to go through than film records. For example, historical or biographical books about past events are available in every bookstore and public library, whereas filmed records sometimes are not accessible for people from other countries. Written documents are also suitable for people who want to get only a brief review of past events because they can flip through the pages quickly. Another reason is that written documents are usually peer-reviewed. Video records stand to be biased because they mostly are for personal uses at that time, while written documents offer an overall perspective verified by historians.",

Personally, I believe that the purpose of education is to develop children\u2019s potential, and this would mean teaching them not only academic subjects but also life skills.",
                "Firstly, the idea that schooling exists only to get young minds through a series of standardized exams can result in a generation of students that know nothing more than studying and who are unable to develop their potential. Education is meant to be a tool to empower and uplift children, to prepare them for the world and to ensure they thrive within it; to twist it into a mere scheme for achieving high scores on exams is to miss the point entirely, and could result in them not being able to discover hidden talents. Children who are taught to cook at an early age, for example, might find that it is their specialty - as they grow up, they might rather be a chef than an average worker.",
                "Secondly, whilst some will argue that this job should be delegated to the parents, relying on them to teach essential life skills is a flawed idea as they are not likely to have both the experience and the opportunity to teach such skills. Most low income families hold down two or three jobs at once, and are unable to make the time to teach such skills; students should therefore be taught basic housework skills in order to take care of themselves and support their parents. By saving time cooking, for instance, mothers can instead focus on answering emails, allowing them to supplement family income and better support their child in other ways.",

Those who are of early age might not be able to read, and as such, might pick up their spoken vocabulary from TV instead. Children\u2019s shows on channels such as Nickelodeon are hugely popular for this reason, as parents allow their kids to tune in to not only be entertained but to improve their skills at the same time.",
                "Nonetheless, it is true that some forms of creative and linguistic expression are conveyed better in writings than on TV. These are things such as character backgrounds or subtle details that can be obsessively explored in books. It would be more difficult for audio-visual mediums such as films to convey the same features in similar lengths. This is why many people often complain that movie adaptations often do not live up to the standards of the book, for the latter is able to delve into the nitty-gritty of the storyline better than a movie more often than not. Books could therefore be better for imagination and development past a certain age.",

Firstly, many scientists proved that trees improve a lot of environmental metrics within a short time. For example, planting more trees results in cleaner air, lower average temperature, and a reduced carbon footprint. Secondly, allocating more space to trees can improve the aesthetic look of cities. For example, cities can build more botanical gardens that host various flowers and other beautiful plants. From an architectural aspect, this can add more contrast between the sharp look of buildings and the softer look of plants and flowers.",
                "Moreover, there are indirect benefits when there are more open spaces dedicated to trees. The first one is that to implement this policy, the government might need to demolish many old residential areas to have areas for parks. This decision is beneficial in many ways. For example, new apartment buildings can accommodate more people and ensure a higher quality of life. The second one is that with more parks, citizens can witness an improvement in both their physical and mental health.

                "Firstly, there is simply no evidence that incarceration effectively reduces the chance that criminals will engage in crime after release - in fact, there is plenty of evidence against this idea. After serving their time in jail, ex-convicts often face large difficulties reentering the workforce as a result of punitive entry barriers, with the end result being a certain relapse as they have no other choice but crime. Countries with harsh punishment such as the US, for example, do much worse than countries such as Norway in terms of the recidivism rate; one could argue that the latter has been able to excel because of its educational approach to prisoners.",
                "Secondly, education and training programs in prisons have been shown to dramatically increase the chances of inmates becoming a productive member of society after their release, as employers are more likely to hire them. A lot of the inmates suffer as a result of being from low-income, poor education backgrounds, with no viable skill set needed for the job market. Job training and further education programs, thus, have been proven to provide inmates with jobs and prevent them from relapsing into crime in countries such as Switzerland.",

Poor people usually resort to committing crimes, such as thefts, robberies, sexual assault, or minor social indecencies like being fake beggars or flashing oneself.

Firstly, this solution does not guarantee to be successful in helping the homeless. Many have become accustomed to the begging life for so long that they are now incapable of feeling inclined to work, especially when they know they can beg for money and food. For example, many still act like they are disabled to ask for charity when they can work. Another problem is that this investment in charity housing will take a toll on taxpayers.

Firstly, many languages are notoriously difficult to learn, such as Mandarin, Vietnamese, or Thai. To be only moderately fluent in these languages means investing hours into learning. Many activities, like studying and working abroad, will be limited if these expectations are there. Another reason is that, in many countries, locals are fluent in more than one language. For example, most Taiwanese and Malays speak English fluently. Many cultures, like Thai, are also heavily influenced by other foreign cultures. As a result, foreigners from English-speaking countries have little trouble renting houses, buying groceries, or befriending locals even if they do not speak the language.",

Firstly, even though some countries have citizens fluent in popular languages like English or Spanish, most of them are young people living in urban areas.

For example, if a fresh graduate wants to work in a South Korean company, one must speak Korean fluently even if the company communicates in both Korean and English.

This solution is not effective as this would only generate more labor without job listings to accommodate them.",
                "Another reason why I think this idea is ill-advised is I believe that education beyond primary schools is essential. Primary schools only teach students basic math and little language skills. Moreover, the majority of students this age have low self-discipline. This means that to prepare them for the workforce, they will need extensive education to acquire both in-depth knowledge and soft skills. The current education system solves this problem by providing students with academic knowledge and various opportunities to practice these skills. Communication skills and self-discipline are also trained through group assignments and the pressure to perform well. All in all, this new solution does not do anything that the current system cannot.",
                "In conclusion, I do not support the idea because it is both ineffective and unoriginal. Unemployment rates have to be solved by other means, rather than proposing that students quit formal education at such a young age."

                "I believe lecture halls are the most effective way to educate a large group of students due to various reasons. Firstly, this teaching method saves resources for both educational institutions and students. For example, most online classroom platforms, like Zoom, will charge institutions for student accounts, whereas lecture halls are university properties, and their maintenance costs, when divided among students, are cheaper. Secondly, lecture halls are better for classes that require direct communication between students and professors. For example, discussion-based courses, like writing or philosophy, have proved to go better in lecture halls because students can build personal relationships among fellow students and the lecturer. Classes involving doing experiments would also benefit from this teaching format.",
                "However, that is not to say that online classes do not offer any benefits at all. One of their main advantages is that they are suitable for people with strict schedules, like working students. Attending online non-synchronous classes can benefit them because it is significantly easier to work or travel and still catch up with course materials. Another advantage is that online lectures are usually better than face-to-face ones at helping students to review the materials. Students can re-watch lecture videos and read slides to prepare for exams. On the contrary, when attending lecture halls, students have to diligently take notes, since few lecturers allow recording in classes. Moreover, when reviewing online lectures, students can speed up these videos to save time on content that they feel confident in.",
                "In conclusion, I believe that both face-to-face lectures and online classes have their advantages to offer both students and lecturers. As a result, I strongly disagree that one will be replaced by another, at least soon."

                "Firstly, doing nothing at all will aggravate the stress from both physical and mental standpoints. Being idle will make you think more about your stressors because your mind will eventually wander to what you worry the most about at the moment. For example, many people reported failing to calm themselves down during stressful times because they keep thinking about work, school, or relationships, which are common stressors. Another point is that studies have shown exercises produce adrenaline and dopamine, which are chemicals responsible for being focused and happy. This finding means that being active is much better for your mental health than sitting around doing nothing.",
                "Secondly, I think the most effective way to not get stressed out is to resolve your stressors rather than doing nothing. Not taking any actions means avoiding your problems, which means that even if you manage to successfully stay calm at this moment, you eventually will have to face your stressors at another time. Moreover, when people take actions associated with their source of stress, like reviewing their resumes, doing more practice tests, or seeing a therapist, they will feel better regardless of the results due to a sense of accomplishment. Another action to be taken is talking to friends. Many people share their worries to seek empathy or approval, thus relieving stress.",

                "There are many reasons why people are skeptical about using interviews to examine candidates\u2019 qualities. Firstly, an interview does not fully reflect candidates\u2019 abilities, especially for candidates applying to technical positions in the IT and engineering industries. For these positions, the best way to assess their abilities is through tests, such as programming tests, case studies, or teamwork sessions with other candidates. Secondly, it is hard to evaluate candidates through interviews because they can lie. Many people admitted to having lied at least once, especially when asked about their past experiences or projects. For example, many told recruiters that they significantly contributed to projects that they hardly participated in.",
                "However, I still think that recruiters should combine interviews with other evaluations because they are still efficient. The first advantage is that the interview gives both employers and applicants a chance to see if applicants are suitable for the company\u2019s culture. For example, employers can observe candidates\u2019 manners, dress codes, or attitudes, whereas candidates can see how other workers are treated. Another advantage of interviews is that they are quick and easy to conduct. Most employers will spend only 30 minutes interviewing candidates before usually giving a tour around the workplace. This is also the most direct way to communicate with applicants because both parties can discuss sensitive topics that otherwise would be inappropriate to touch on, such as salary, benefits, or workplace culture.",
                "In conclusion, I agree that for technology companies, using only interviews as an assessment during their hiring process is not sufficient. However, recruiters should not eliminate or replace interviews."

Although spending on protecting these kinds of wild animals can sometimes be beneficial to humans, I would argue that it is of higher importance to allocate these resources to the human population.",
                "On the one hand, it is reasonable to provide financial support for wildlife protections. In fact, by saving wild animals, humans are saving themselves. Wild animals, for instance, may hold the keys to certain medical breakthroughs, just as many modern medicines are based on compounds found in plants. Moreover, humans, animals and other forms of life all form a giant ecosystem whereby each part can influence the others. If a certain animal becomes less common, this, in turn, will reduce the population of the animals that prey on it, which is more likely to disrupt the ecological balance and eventually threatens the survival of human society.",
                "However, it is sometimes difficult for people to accept that these perfectly legitimate reasons outweigh the immediate requirements of the human population. If money is not available to people who have problems such as mental illness, physical disabilities or to those living in dire poverty, it is inevitable that some will suggest spending less on wild animals. There is a strong argument that by spending more on the education of humans, we could make the world a better place for us and for wild animals.",

This is not to suggest that we cut all funding for wildlife projects since many of these projects can directly benefit humans. However, a key argument for me is that by spending money on people, we can improve the world generally."

                "First, audiences are increasingly bombarded with negative stories and therefore, good news should be reported more often to balance out. In fact, journalism\u2019s commitment to being society\u2019s watchdog is understandable, but excessive negativity in the news can be harmful. For instance, after a tragic plane crash in Malaysia was broadcast, news agencies the world over started to report similar accidents during the next months. This created collective fear for air travel, which consequently hurt the aviation industry despite the fact that air transport is still the safest option, with incident rates far lower than those for road and rail transport. In this way, an excessive amount of bad news causes distorted views and this is why the more good news is worth reporting.",
                "Secondly, happiness is highly contagious, hence the need for positive media coverage. Good news can inspire readers or viewers to take action, which can benefit themselves and even society as a whole. The success of Flappy Bird, a mobile game created by Dong Nguyen that caused a global sensation in 2013, has been an encouraging story. Thousands of Vietnamese app developers have subsequently tried to start their own businesses in order to follow in Dong Nguyen\u2019s footsteps. Although very few of them can achieve similar success, entrepreneurship is promoted, which comes as good news for both developers themselves and the country\u2019s economy.",

                "On the one hand, there is no doubt that a magnificent outer space can bring about the immense commercial value. For example, with shopping centers or apartments for rent, it is the outward appearance that attracts the customers\u2019 attention. A person who gets a positive first impression of the exterior is more likely to enter the building to ask for services. Therefore, the outlook of the constructions is always regarded as an effective advertising tool that brings considerable revenues for their owners. In addition, some buildings symbolizing the history of the city they are located in also need to be beautiful from the outside. Take the Hanoi Opera House as an example, it has long been considered a Vietnamese cultural site, so maintaining its attractive exterior is undoubtedly an essential task.",
                "On the other hand, the function is also of significance to a building. The first reason is that every construction needs to be safe and comfortable. For instance, a shopping mall has to possess a wide walkway, a good lighting system, and adequate emergency exits. Furthermore, each building has its own practical use, so architects have to design it with a view to satisfying the requirements of the building\u2019s users. A theatre, for example, is supposed to have a well-designed sound system and a scientifically-arranged hall so that everyone in the audience can conveniently enjoy movies or shows.",

To explain it further, poor road conditions are considered a major reason for road casualties. For example, narrow roads and sharp curves often force even law-abiding drivers to make mistakes. Therefore, it should be noted that drivers alone cannot be blamed for such mishaps, and giving them stricter punishments in these cases is no solution. A more effective strategy by the government would be to straighten accident prone-curves and widen narrow roads. A larger number of road signs and proper traffic signals can also be effective in reducing accidents on roads.",

For instance, poor visibility due to dense mist and rain, slippery roads on account of snowfall making driving difficult and causing serious accidents in many countries. Stricter punishment for drivers is a futile exercise in handling such problems. Modern technological innovations on cars' wheels or on-road design should be used to deal with such emergency situations. On the other hand, reckless driving, speeding, and breach of traffic rules by careless drivers have caused many accidents.

                "It has been said that physical ability is the most crucial aspect in achieving success in sports, while others argue that other essential variables are involved. Both physical and intellectual ability, in my opinion, are equally significant to achieving success on the athletic field.",
                "Firstly, physical prowess is necessary for success in sports since most sporting activities entail some sort of physical ability. Even while various sports require varied levels of strength from the individual, the team with the most muscular bodies will often triumph. This is because sports were initially invented to highlight physical abilities like speed, strength, and stamina. In a football game, for instance, the team with players that are physically able to cover more ground faster has a better chance of winning. This also happens in most other sports, and it has been widely accepted that a well-trained physique can boost the likelihood of victory.",
                "On the other hand, although physical ability certainly helps increase one's chances of winning, many people also believe having a strong mind is essential. Even if all players are physically capable of defeating the other squad, the team might still be vulnerable when they lack the skill to use strategic moves effectively. In sports such as basketball, for instance, even when the opposing team is in greater physical condition, the team with superior plans and preparation not only overwhelms the opponent but ultimately causes them to lose the game. In instances like these, intellectual capacity is crucial in sports.",
                "In conclusion, I believe that having a solid intellect is crucial to succeeding on the sports field, even while physical talent helps boost one's chances of winning."

                "On the one hand, to flaunt their riches and elevate their social position, some individuals spend a disproportionate amount of money on lavish family celebrations. Proponents of this idea often point out that weddings and other family ceremonies are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. For this reason, it becomes reasonable to allocate more budgets to ensure that important occasions leave lasting impressions on everyone involved. A family's socioeconomic position is sometimes judged by the care with which they plan their family celebrations. Their social standing will improve with the more significant expense of the gathering. This is especially pertinent and advantageous when family members work in political or relationship-related sectors.",
                "On the other hand, there are several problems with throwing lavish family festivities. The first is that an unhealthy fixation on money may cause one to become obsessed with material things. This means surface characteristics are given greater weight in social judgments than core values. Second, this practice might encourage inequality. Peer pressure and ridicule may be especially harsh for young adults who lack the resources to invest in luxurious birthday parties. There is already evidence of this tendency in countries where money is idolized, such as China, where they shame one another over the cost of their birthday parties and weddings.",

Regarding the former advantage, wise planning can help people to identify exactly which direction they should follow in the future. Arrangement in advance provides us more opportunities to look forward and examine the benefits and drawbacks of each goal that we set, thereby reducing the risks involved and increasing the chances of success. In addition, thanks to good planning skills, individuals may reasonably allocate resources that they currently have.

Therefore, there are high chances that he will be successful.",

Despite the number of failures we have to face in life, there are still possibilities of success once we are consistent in accomplishing our goals.

Chief among these is that those who pursue traditional music has spent a plethora of time and attempt to be adept at using instruments and the specific style of each category of classical music. Obviously, traditional music requires not only thorough understanding of its nature but also the talent as well as constant practice to deliver the best piece of music enjoyed by the public. Concerning the second viewpoint, classical music plays a paramount importance in preserving traditional values of a country. It is true that the more money artists performing classical music can earn, the more possible that they would not change jobs. As a result, there are chances that future generations can still enjoy one of some masterpieces in music field.",

With regard to the former, the majority of pop stars have to face the challenge of a short-lived career since the entertainment industry is constantly changing. Consequently, for around one or two decades of contribution, most of those well-known artists would be replaced by other more talent and dynamic ones. Another point is that performers of pop music always trying to set good examples especially when presenting in public. Since they aware of their significant impact on people, particularly teenagers, great effort in creating and maintaining favourable figure has been made by these individuals. Therefore, it is logical that stars performing pop music should earn more money.",

                "On the one hand, developments in technology have paved the way for an emerging kind of crime: cyber-crime. As most transactions nowadays are done via the Internet, thieves can hack into one\u2019s account and tamper with online transactions, sending the money to his bank account instead of that of the actual recipient of the payment. A milder case would be information thievery, in which one\u2019s personal information would be stolen and sold to a third party, who, in a positive case, are advertising companies, or to catfishes, in the worst case scenario. For example, a number of frauds in Vietnam happened to middle-aged women, who were swindled out of millions by imposters acting as their children or relatives online.",
                "On the other hand, technological advancements have helped solve cases faster and prevent criminal activities. First, high-tech gears and programs can help detect offenders effectively and in a timely manner. To illustrate, a 35-year-old cold case in Texas has just been solved using DNA technology. The 1986 murder was thought to be hopeless as no visible evidences were found, yet innovations in crime science has brought new and concrete proofs. Another use of technological developments is to prevent crimes. What this means is that through the use of technology, crime attempts can be deterred. For example, released convicts will usually be forced to wear a GPS tracking device. Thanks to this, many criminals have abandoned their recidivism plan as they could be easily sent back to jail.",
                "To conclude, although there are sound arguments as to why technology developments can facilitate crimes, I believe that, in reality, it can help avert criminal activities."

                "On the one hand, being able to use fresh, clean water is a human's basic necessity. First, besides food, water is another fundamental contributing to human\u2019s well-being. Therefore, if people were not to get an adequate amount of water to sustain basic activities such as hydrating themselves, cooking, and cleaning, their human rights would have been violated. Secondly, people have varying needs for water so restricting the amount of water used to an average number would be disadvantageous to those whose businesses involve heavy water usage, for example, people involved in farming activities.",
                "On the other hand, introducing regulations on fresh water usage can have undeniable positive effects. Water is a scarce resource, so making it freely available can lead to depletion of fresh water and unequal distribution of water. As a matter of fact, water sources have been depleting in recent years due to global warming, droughts, and pollution. Consequently, if individuals are free to use water at their own discretion, it will lead to faster exhaustion of this rare resource.

While some contend that the government should establish boundaries for violent content, others argue that these films have to be banned. In my opinion, violence in movies should only be limited, not prohibited.",
                "On the one hand, it is understandable why violent films should be banned, because it can leave a negative influence on people\u2019s psyche. Due to the internet and pirated movie websites, if not supervised carefully, children can gain access to age-inappropriate films. In the case of adults, the popularity of villain protagonists can lead to misunderstandings that the antisocial behaviors portrayed are encouraged. What is alarming is these young people are impressionable and therefore, can establish riotous behaviors after prolonged exposure. For example, in Japan, a 24-year-old man dressed up as \u201cThe Joker\u201d - a notorious fictional villain - and set a train on fire after stabbing fellow passengers. However, the majority of individuals can set a boundary between real life and fiction, thus, banning violent films is rather excessive.",
                "On the other hand, violent films are a form of entertainment for a part of audiences and therefore, should not be prohibited. These viewers find joy from the thrill and excitement offered by violent elements in movies, so forbidding their hobbies for the sake of a minority of audiences equals practicing injustice upon these individuals. Furthermore, without actions, movie makers will lack a key ingredient in building films\u2019 charms. Nowadays, 90% of movies are sprinkled with violence, as even the slightest form of physical conflicts can be considered violent. Consequently, filtering savage elements will be a tantalizing task and oftentimes impossible as it would dull the plotline. Therefore, the optimal solution would be to restrict the appearance of gratuitous and extreme violence in movies.",
                "In conclusion, although there are reasonable arguments as to why violent films must be banned, the best solution is to regulate violent contents based on their levels."

                "On the one hand, joint efforts from all nations can have positive effects on the environment. First, as many environmental crimes are operated cross-border, governments must collaborate to detect and deplete these activities. By way of illustration, illegal logging in Southeast Asia spans across the lands of Brunei, Laos, Indonesia, et cetera. Each country accounts for a part in the illegal wood supply chain. Therefore, Southeast Asian nations should cooperate to destroy the illegal timber production line, as a country\u2019s lone effort would only result in the contemporary eradication of a mere portion of the chain. Secondly, international cooperation allows countries to learn from each other and create optimal solutions to similar problems. Nations with matching backgrounds can use each other\u2019s campaigns as case studies and apply accordingly to their respective countries, resulting in better effectiveness.",
                "On the other hand, the world economy will gain considerable advantages through multinational cooperation. Thanks to globalization, many businesses are having subsidiaries worldwide, creating numerous job opportunities for the locals. For example, various underdeveloped areas are receiving a boost in economic growth due to international companies constructing their off-shore headquarters there. Hai Phong in Vietnam, where Samsung built their subsidiary office, is an exemplary example as the province has welcomed an increasing number of laborers. Additionally, multinational conglomerates can enjoy attractive economic incentives from foreign nations, thus helping them save additional costs on tax and more. In Vietnam, Lego enjoyed feed-in tariffs, tax exemptions, and investment subsidies for building their first carbon neutral plant in the country.",

First and foremost, most students lack emotional maturity and thorough understanding of the world\u2019s workings to give constructive comments. In case a student is impulsive and immature, he could sabotage the teacher\u2019s reputation by giving unjust criticisms should he be hostile towards the teacher for giving him bad marks or reprimanding him.

To start with, the core of education is to serve students and equip them with more knowledge, thus, understanding their insight and needs are critical to being a successful educator. Through learners\u2019 responses, teachers could refine their methods and make adjustments to their lesson plans to better suit their students, resulting in more educated and motivated learners.

Advertisements can give new products recognition and help educate first-time buyers. This means that it can introduce innovative services that have never existed before to the public, or partly guide clueless consumers who have never purchased a product before on its range and qualities. A prime example of this is Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign. In the old days, Nike\u2019s products catered mostly to athletes, but in the late 1980s, Nike created this campaign to introduce its shoes to the masses.

Advertising\u2019s core mission is to keep customers informed, however, this is a double-edged sword, as new yearnings are also created, preventing people from being satisfied with what they have and boosting consumerism culture.

For well-off people, life will become a constant race to possess the next ground-breaking products, while for less fortunate ones, they will unconsciously suffer from feelings of inferiority due to not having what is considered good - as stated on advertisements. These are unhealthy modes of living that people should not have to experience.",

Concerning individuals, being loyal to a position means that their incentives are high, including seniority bonuses as well as labor insurance. Whereas job hoppers can never expect this as their short-term work will always put their benefits at a new employee level. As for companies, having faithful employees can help them cut training costs and avoid problems that can arise from newcomers. When a new member joins the team, the company has to pay for their lack of efficiency and experience.

This is because students who have varying academic merits have different acquisition speed. Therefore, grouping them together in a lesson will cause weaker students confusion and stronger students time. By dividing pupils based on their skill-sets, schools can have more well-paced curriculums. To illustrate, gifted schools in Vietnam all have specialized classes where students can acquire knowledge in their chosen field more intensively, thus advancing in their academic abilities quicker. Meanwhile, pupils in normal classrooms can take time learning these subjects at their own discretion.",
                "On the other hand, advocates of integrating students with different aptitudes also have grounds to believe that this approach will facilitate a more holistic learning environment. As all students excel in a different field, what pupils in a mixed class will have is the chance to exchange their knowledge with one another. Students who are well-versed in a subject can aid others in learning by sharing their tips.

                "First of all, team sports are beneficial as they can help foster various desirable qualities in a person. A great team player is oftentimes also a supportive and cooperative friend, and a visionary who is capable of utilizing team members\u2019 strengths when and where appropriate. A case in point is double badminton. To win a match, both players must understand how each other plays. Only in that case can both athletes find a suitable arrangement within a match. Next, both have to place their trust in the other person\u2019s ability to cover the arena. Moreover, team sports can help build great camaraderie, especially for working adults who do not have time to mingle.",
                "Nevertheless, individual sports are quite advantageous in some cases. It allows the players to learn more about themselves and focus on improving their ability alone. By having to fully bear the weight of any loss or take credit for any success, the player will grow to be a responsible, self-reliant, and confident person. Take chess for example, in most cases, chess is an individual sport as this game requires complete trust in one\u2019s ability, speed, and the ability to foresight. All of which are difficult to achieve in team sports where many minds are involved in the decision making process.",
                "Overall, even though individual sports offer some positives to a certain extent, I completely agree with the idea that team sports is more beneficial to people since it can help them develop valuable attributes."

                "Of course, there are legitimate reasons why people have concerns about this development. The first concern is that AI will one day control the human species. This concern, although sounding like it is straight from sci-fi movies, is reasonable. This dystopia happens when computers can teach themselves and develop into a supercomputer, making humans its servants. Another concern is more realistic, saying that computers will take over human\u2019s jobs. When computers are capable of accurately completing mundane tasks, they are capable of replacing human workers. As a result, many people will find themselves unemployed when this happens.",
                "However, there are various benefits that intelligent computers bring to humans. The first advantage is that computers utilize resources better than humans do. They complete tasks faster, more efficiently, and have less demand than humans. For example, computers do not need to be paid, be fed, or be accommodated in housing. As a result, using computers as labor will save on resources that can be allocated to human development. The second advantage is that AI brings convenience to humans. The age of AI means less physical labor and more accessible information to other people. For example, humans can see improvements in health since they do not have to work as hard as before. Some applications of AI can even help humans to make better decisions as a result of multiple algorithms. This application can save humans from the tiring process of checking out the pros and cons of a decision.",
                "In conclusion, there are both positives and negatives to developing computers that are as intelligent as humans. However, I think that the positives outweigh the negatives in terms of resource utilization and providing convenience."

I personally contend that although starting early might be economically beneficial for the family in the short run, it might ultimately be a futile endeavour as the children would be unable to absorb the information in the long run.",
                "One could argue that by starting children on their path of formal education sooner may help support parents financially. Parents often struggle to arrange babysitters and have to resort to expensive daycares that are of no real benefit to them or their children, and if schooling started earlier, this would be a financial stress they would not have to cope with. Primary education in many Western countries, for example, is free for this reason: it allows parents to save money to spend on other things for their family.",
                "However, as children are still in the early developmental stages for the first few years of their lives,\u00a0 they would undoubtedly lack the abilities to understand the things taught to them to a sufficient degree. More specifically, since children may not be capable of recalling their lessons, time and money spent on them would simply be wasted. Most adults today, for example, will find it almost impossible to recall what they have learnt in primary school. It could be argued that these early years of a children\u2019s life should instead be spent being emotionally bonded with the parents instead of being taught skills they would forget later on anyway.",
                "Ultimately, I argue that despite short term economic benefits to the family, the inability of young children to learn what is presented to them means that they should not start education at too early of an age."

First of all, people reap the benefits of getting news free of charge and in an instantaneous manner. It does not matter where the reader lives, as long as there is access to the internet, any news from all over the world can be updated on his phone. And plus, as online news channels operate mostly with profits from advertisements, users can oftentimes catch up with happenings for free. Another advantage is that people can have a better reading experience on modern media. Whether the reader is keen on learning news visually or auditorily, there are enough alternatives to cater to their preferences. Such convenience makes obtaining news from other media sources an enjoyable experience.",
                "On the other hand, I opine that traditional newspapers remain the best source of information thanks to its accessibility and reliability. This is because traditional newspapers are more accessible for computerphobes and the older generations whose majority are technologically illiterate. Newspapers also have one more advantage over modern media, which is its reliability. While the internet is vulnerable to fake news and false information, newspapers, which have to undergo a rigorous examination by professionals and the government, can offer readers great accuracy. To illustrate, YouTube - one of the largest online platforms in the world - has just been dubbed as a major conduit of disinformation. During the US presidential election, multiple false narratives were spread around in order to mislead voters using this channel.",

First, it can prevent mortality when it comes to dangerous situations such as touching a naked wire with wet hands or crossing the road without looking at the traffic lights. Without parental guidance, children may perform these actions and harm themselves, which could be extremely probable among toddlers who have not had full control of their actions and proper understanding of their surroundings. Therefore, children should be educated on essential knowledge for survival before they have any chance to hurt themselves.",
                "On the other hand, advocates of allowing children to make mistakes freely also have grounds to believe why this practice is beneficial. Firstly, children will learn to become responsible. As children face consequences from their choices, the lessons learnt will stay with them longer. This is because the repercussions can instill fear of the wrongdoings into children and prevent them from taking similar courses of action. Another point is that having the autonomy to make mistakes will equip children with sharper minds. To be more specific, having to come up with a solution for their mishaps will help children develop problem solving skills and build their confidence should these resolutions prove to be useful.",

Gone are the days of delineating heirs and \u201cpure bloodlines\u201d, and being a son or daughter of a past monarchy means little in most countries today. Concerning oneself with a long lost past, rather than looking ahead and tending to the generations we have now is a waste of the precious time we have to engage and learn from the generations that are still around us. Learning that one is part Chinese or Korean, for example, does not ultimately change who they are as a person or who they should associate with.",
                "On the other hand, learning about ancestry is a way of feeling closer to one\u2019s own family, for it is a way of seeing the roots of one\u2019s own family tree and honouring where we come from. This could potentially be of great comfort to orphans, or those who do not know who their parents are.

To illustrate, in Hoi An - a famed ancient city in Vietnam that is known for its touristy streets filled with old houses, all the buildings are required to duplicate the style of age-old ones in the area. This is to preserve the ancient look, which is one of the city\u2019s main attractions. Even international brands such as Starbucks have to conform to this obligation.",
                "On the other hand, I side with the view that how a house is designed should lie with the owners alone and not the authorities. To begin with, a traditional design may cause inconveniences. For instance, a modern family of five would find it difficult to live in a single-storey house with limited land area. Therefore, if the government prohibits buildings with multiple storeys, the family would have to live in discomfort. Furthermore, a design from another time may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Being able to reside where they feel content is anyone\u2019s individual liberties, thus, being forced to live in a house whose design they dislike would be unreasonable.",

Players always face life-threatening perils once they decide to take part in extreme sports, especially those that involve highly specialized gears, namely skydiving, motor-racing, or mountain climbing. However experienced the participants are, though rare, chances are that the required equipment can malfunction, thus causing the participants fatal wounds or even deaths.

                "Advertising, on the one hand, is an industry which can help connect consumers and businesses through the dissemination of information. Individuals with a certain set of demand can pinpoint which products they want to buy, and from where through advertisements. In addition, businesses can set themselves apart from their competitors by showcasing what makes their products unique, thereby attracting more buyers. Overall, this helps to facilitate more monetary transactions, stimulating the economy and benefitting buyers and sellers alike. This is the reason why for instance the advertising industry is so large, and why it employs as many people as it does.",
                "On the other hand, I argue that advertising creates a materialist culture by equating products with happiness. Advertising today works by making associations between certain products with positive emotions or traits. For instance, whereas Coca Cola is functionally a sugary drink which can cause a plethora of negative health effects, its mass advertising campaigns result in it being associated with summer and sports. As a result, instead of looking inwards and becoming happier through working on ourselves, individuals increasingly equate buying and consuming more with being happier.

Firstly, most traditions are derived from living experiences of older generations and were passed down for centuries; so they help maintain relationships with one another.

Secondly, following culturally-related traditions helps a person shape one\u2019s cultural identity. For example, many second-generation Vietnamese Americans still celebrate Tet as a way to identify themselves.\u00a0",

                "I agree that there should be a special tax on sugary foods and beverages. Firstly, sugar is the culprit for multiple health issues. For example, sugary foods can first lead to obesity and dental problems. A more serious case of overindulgence of sugary foods and beverages can ultimately lead to diabetes, which almost cannot be entirely cured. Another reason why I think sugary foods should be taxed is this tax is a way to relieve the burden on healthcare systems in the future. Health issues involving sugar usually show themselves when individuals are older, and statistically, poorer. This demographic's healthcare is usually subsidized by the government, which is why taxing sugary foods helps to balance out healthcare costs.",
                "However, I can understand why people are against this special tax law. Special taxes on harmful items have been placed on tobacco and alcohol products, for example. Despite this effort, many people are consuming these products regularly. Therefore, many think taxing sugary foods will not make a difference. Some also point out that putting taxes on sugar, without educating people on the reasons for it, can be seen as oppressive to many. For example, only health-conscious people are aware of the dangers high levels of sugar bring. The general public cannot fully understand this, so taxing sugary drinks out of the blue seems oppressive and not transparent. Extreme people may even makeup conspiracies that this tax will only benefit the government.",
                "In conclusion, while I think that there should be a tax on overly sugary foods and drinks, I still believe that the government should carry out this action carefully and inform citizens beforehand."

These are businesses that sell products like reusable water bottles, portable wooden utensils packs, or biodegradable cosmetics.

In my opinion, while our adult years certainly have an effect on our future lives, most of our personality will have been formed by the early periods of our lives.",
                "On the one hand, one could argue that as we get older, our outlook on life is most affected as our personalities have already been formed and we can now have the ability to make our own mistakes. By learning certain things about ourselves, and what to do and what not to do, we will assimilate into wider society better. For instance, important life skills such as doing taxes or investing into a retirement fund can only be communicated to an adult, since children would not be able to understand what is being taught to them. Thus, young adults are in the best position to learn about the world and how to live within it.",
                "On the other hand, I believe that one\u2019s childhood greatly affects their outlook on life. Numerous studies have shown that a healthy upbringing can result in more functional people, whereas the opposite case would likely lead to individuals being more susceptible to mental health issues later in life. Furthermore, when children are taught certain skills at a young age, when their brains have yet to mature, this could paradoxically lead to them being able to learn it quicker. For instance, we can see that young children are able to learn languages much quicker than full grown adults.",

By providing more well rounded education, foreign companies will be more enticed to invest in a particular country, and as such, an educated populace can lead indirectly to more foreign direct investment. An obvious case example is China, where a strong state-funded education sector resulted in a very high literacy rate and subsequently high economic growth when the economy liberalized.",

Therefore, parents that teach their kids anti social behaviour therefore shoulder some of the blame for their child misbehaving. Studies have shown that children growing up in abusive households, for example, are more likely to grow up having psychological issues of their own. Thus, it might be suggested that since children\u2019s cognitive functions are moulded by their parents, they should be punished instead of the child.",
                "On the other hand, to punish the parents of children implies that the child has no free will. Although parenting does play a part in individual action, it must be pointed out that individuals also have a degree of autonomy (this of course by age; a four year old does not have the same level of cognition as a seventeen year old).

From this, many can have crucials insights into their society and culture. For example, the Korean film Parasite presents class conflict through a setting that resonates with many Vietnamese families. After watching the movie, many reported being able to identify class conflicts in their community.

For example, Vietnamese students may want to dye their hair and dress more revealingly after watching movies set in US high schools, despite the action being against school rules. Another reason is that the popularity of foreign movies can squash the growth of domestic ones.

Because an apartment building can host many people, this option will reduce the average rent and house prices. It is most suitable for densely populated cities, like New York, Hong Kong, or Ho Chi Minh City. Also, a city like this has the benefit of providing convenience and a sense of community. Most apartments are pre-furnished and near supermarkets and schools, have security systems and reception areas. These features make life in them comfortable. Some apartments also have Facebook groups to connect residents by letting their kids hang out with each other or going for a walk together.",
                "However, a horizontal development style, which means building on vast land areas, would be more suitable for cities with decentralized residents. What this means is that their citizens are not clumping up near the central areas but rather scattered out in the outskirts. These areas will have lower land prices due to availability. A benefit of living here is that there is more privacy since there will not be as many neighbors as there are in apartments. Another advantage is that children will have more spaces due to houses having a backyard or a garden.

Secondly, education can solve the core issues of global hunger. Food aid is only the chronic solution to the problem, which means it is not addressing the roots of food shortages.

Sports were initially designed to showcase the physical attributes of its participants, and therefore comes at no surprise that strength is an important component for many of them. This is especially true for activities that demand a high level of endurance, such as marathons or swimming, as a small difference in fitness could make a crucial difference to completion time -\u00a0 famous athletes in these sports hence put more time in physical training, such as weightlifting and running drills, rather than mental training alone.",

                "With the advancement of technology, many people think online materials are sufficient for teaching, and printed materials have no place in schools today. I believe this matter depends on both the subject taught and the level of education of students.",
                "Online materials are the solution to protect the environment while still providing convenience for both students and teachers. This type of learning material usually appears in higher education because there are lots of students in courses that require a heavy load of materials. If they are all printed, it would be a considerable amount of paper waste, so online materials are the solution. Another benefit is that online materials come in many forms, such as audio, interactive diagrams, or graphs. It will be more helpful than printed ones for engineering courses and graphic design ones. Also, it is easier to store and share online materials with your peers because it can be done on a laptop and takes up no physical space.",
                "However, that is not to say that printed material has no place in modern education. This type of material is especially suitable for classes that require memorization and annotation. Many subjects, like maths or physics, are hard for note-taking on laptops because they involve various scientific notations, which is why maths is taught by strictly printed materials. Studies also show that memorization is more efficient when students read from printed materials rather than digital ones. Another reason is that printed materials are more user-friendly. This advantage is significant because many teachers and students are not tech-savvy enough to work with digital materials. For example, many underprivileged students in middle and high schools still struggle with using computers due to not having prior exposure.",
                "In conclusion, I think that online materials are suitable for higher education, or for courses that require perusing lots of materials. On the other hand, printed materials are user-friendly and suitable for classes with lots of memorization and annotation."

                "Some could argue that longer commutes may provide the workers and students with the ability to decompress prior to arriving at work, as it gives them the time to rest between potential domestic troubles and workplace issues.

For example, many workers today take the time out in their morning commute to listen to podcasts and music or reply to emails.",
                "On the one hand, long commutes and inflexible work hours might result in the worker and student losing out on sleep, resulting in them arriving at the office or school tired and not nearly as productive as they could be. This is further compounded when the worker or student must sleep at earlier hours, affecting their personal and domestic duties, such as being able to spend less time with their family.

                "On the one hand, many animal activists do have a point in arguing that zoos can be cruel. They are often mockeries of the animals natural habitats, and far too small to accommodate the animals that inhabit them. A lot of the animals in zoos are not as in shape as they would be in the wild, since they have regular feeding hours and no longer have any need to hunt. This in turn leads to them becoming unhealthy and living shorter lives. Many captive gorillas, for example, have been observed to have a lower lifespan than their free-roaming counterparts.",

Poaching has been a huge issue in recent years, and has contributed to a number of species going extinct. Zoos, meanwhile, are controlled places where the animals are under observation and protected by security at all times. Many zoos are currently being used in Africa in order to protect endangered species of rhino, for example, and as they have been shown to save many species from the cusp of extinction, they are a necessary evil for wildlife to continue to exist.",

Thus, one might suggest that the billions of dollars poured into marketing yearly, for instance, is a testament to the ongoing effectiveness of advertising.",

                "As a point of consideration, when tourists invest in local cultural traditions, these traditions become a production that must be put on in order to please these tourists, leading to the loss of authenticity over time. Tourism places unnecessary stress on local customs, for they must appeal to tourists for their ideas about the culture and fulfill this expectation. Through a gradual process of change, there might not be any semblance of the old tradition left.

Firstly, by sending signals to space to look for life, scientists can also learn more about the universe. For example, many celestial bodies, such as massive black holes, galaxies, or earth-like planets, have been discovered when pulsating signals. Secondly, searching for a sign of life outside of the Earth can be educational for us. Suppose we find a life that had existed years ago but is now extinct: we can learn from their extinction to prevent the same destiny from happening to ourselves. Moreover, if we do detect signals from a superior species, we then have enough time to prepare ourselves, either to hide from them or to fight back. In both cases, it is rewarding.",

Many theories, like the Fermi paradox, have pointed out that the reason why we cannot reach the other species is that it is so intelligent that our signals mean nothing. An analogy often used is that we are ants living on the sidewalk, not knowing that humans exist on the other side. Likewise, the alien species might also have the power to exterminate humans if we disturb them. Another drawback is that even if we manage to meet an inferior species, this does not guarantee that it will not become superior to us in the long run. For example, through an exchange of technology, it can learn faster than humans, thus ruling our planet.",

As a result, students and professors of these universities feel motivated by pride to put more effort into their studies and research to continuously bring more achievements to the university. Another advantage of this policy is that this creates an environment that is spear-headed towards learning and researching. This environment will incentivize students and professors to undergo academic research. For example, teaching in schools like these will be easier for professors as they need not spend much time on the materials, so they can devote more time to nurturing innovative ideas. As a result, more students will have a chance to put their academic knowledge into use.",

For example, a student may come from an underprivileged area and could not afford tutoring centers, thus not having enough materials to practice.

Firstly, this money is from citizens\u2019 taxes, and it is only fair if they receive direct benefits from these tax payments. As a result, building facilities that can help them maintain their shape is more important than investing in only a few individuals. Secondly, the consequences of not investing enough in public sports facilities are more critical than those in top athletes. For example, if citizens do not have space to exercise, they run a higher risk of developing more illnesses. These illnesses are a burden to society. Because of this, it is more beneficial for countries with limited budgets to invest in the public.",

Secondly, famous athletes serve as both entertainment and motivation for the public.

                "On the one hand, the alteration of enterprises\u2019 places would exert negative effects on their interests relating to the unavailability of resources and potential customers. Chief among these is that infrastructure and human resources are not immediately accessible in the suburbs. For example, major banks would suffer from inadequacies of well-trained employees because they are out of reach for high-quality graduates from many universities. Not to mention that enterprises moving to the outskirts would impede their businesses as profits cannot be generated easily. For example, the failure in attracting customers of high-end clothes stores results in their lower revenues, which negatively impacts the businesses\u2019 survival in the market.",
                "On the other hand, the moving of businesses to the countryside plays a pivotal role in reducing the number of over-crowding related issues in the cities and employment problems in the countryside. Concerning the former advantage, the change in companies\u2019 operation place requires their workers to move from the center to the outskirts, which would significantly decrease the amount of transportation and population in the central areas. Therefore, congestion and rising housing prices would be less problematic, thereby enhancing city citizens\u2019 living standards. In addition, businesses moving to rural areas creates more job opportunities for workers who live in those places. By joining the workforce, those individuals can generate more gains, which is paramount in lessening income inequality between rural and urban citizens.",
                "In conclusion, the governmental encouragement of altering companies\u2019 places of business may cause difficulties for businesses due to their inaccessibility of resources and lower chances of stimulating profits. Nevertheless, such a practice is deemed more advantageous in terms of its potential in diminishing the adverse effects of rising transportation and accommodation costs."

                "There are various benefits to this mandatory volunteer work. Firstly, it will help young people develop a sense of responsibility and community. By helping out people with whom they are familiar when growing up, they will feel more thankful and personally connected with their neighborhood. Secondly, through unpaid volunteer work, young people can significantly alleviate social problems and improve the quality of life in their community. Younger people nowadays are more open-minded and creative, which means when they channel these strengths into solving local problems, new solutions will arise. For example, many have developed group chats on social media to create an exercise-buddy program, encouraging people to do more physical activities.",
                "However, there are still some disadvantages associated with this policy. The first drawback is that the time devoted to voluntary work will be an interruption in their studies or their work. Many students can easily forget knowledge learned after just a few months of not continuing their studies. The second drawback is that if this policy is mandatory, it can pose a stressor on the younger generation. For example, many already have multiple responsibilities to tend to, like taking care of their siblings, working for their families, or struggling to study or find a job. Adding yet another one will cause them to carry out the volunteer work carelessly. Some may even publicly object to it, thinking that they are stripped of their freedom.",
                "In conclusion, it is undeniable that this policy carries some disadvantages, especially for people in underdeveloped areas. However, I think that if it is encouraged, rather than mandated, it is generally advantageous."

                "On the one hand, the aging population plays a practical role in providing assistance for young generations in family and society. With regard to the former, full-time working young adults these days tend to rely on older people in childcare, which is proven to lighten financial burden on newly-wedded couples. In Vietnam, for example, there is a majority of grandparents who are in charge of caring for their grandchildren whose parents\u2019 schedules are usually hectic during working hours. On a societal level, seniors have ample life experience passed down from one generation to the next as valuable lessons which are essential in assisting young people to tackle obstacles and guiding them to the right path in life. Thus, the fact that older people will rise in number can be advantageous in helping the younger ones lead a peaceful life and ensure general well-being.",
                "Nevertheless, I think that a higher proportion of older people can bring major drawbacks including burdens on economic aspects and health services. Some may say that the elder is no longer regarded as productive workforces of society, thus the growth in number of this group results in a shortage of qualified workers. This may lead to unfortunate consequences such as declining productivity, higher labor costs, and in the end, cause stagnation in the economy. Coupled with this is that the increasing number of senior populations stimulates the demand for healthcare. Allocation of ample amounts of state funds, therefore, have to be distributed to improve services and facilities in the health sector. The practice may create uneven development in the general prosperity of nations as more resources which are supposed to be spent on education, construction, etc. to stimulate the economy, are instead directed towards alleviating pressure on healthcare systems.",
                "In conclusion, despite the benefits of providing support for young people in terms of family and society aspects, the increase in the number of old people generates more adverse effects on the national economy and health sector.

                "To begin with, patriotism at its most extreme could be regarded as problematic due to its detrimental impacts on economic and social aspects. With regard to the former, the loyalty that one may express towards their country is attached to a feeling of superiority over other countries. This causes an obstruction in international trade as people regard others from different nations as inferiors; thus, there is no attempt to be made in commercing and exchanging goods worldwide. Turning to the second idea, it is true that in the modern-day, while every nation enjoys equal standing on a global scale, any country putting itself on a pedestal is detrimental to mutual connectivity and often leads to conflict as well as social exclusion of other minorities. Such practice, in extreme cases, maybe the primary cause of terrorism around the globe.",
                "However, despite the aforementioned drawbacks, I think that patriotism can be favorable in terms of promoting solidarity and enhancing national independence. Firstly, patriotism plays a crucial role in uniting people living in the same country. The majority of citizens, undeniably, would value communal senses, and eventually, national unity could be obtained. In this case, patriotism can be supposed as a means of protection which safeguards the country from outside terrorists. Furthermore, without national unity, one country may have to accept unfavorable trading conditions that can be dictated by another country. Thus, it is of paramount importance for a nation to stay independent to avoid adverse effects. For instance, authorities should be aware of the number of goods produced within the country to minimize imported products and consequently be under no control.",
                "In conclusion, although I acknowledge that patriotism, on extreme levels, may be detrimental to a global economy and society, I think that its benefits including enhancing unity and national independence are more considerable."

                "The main advantage is that being influenced by those who belong to the same age group or social group could play a crucial role in reinforcing positive habits and attitudes in social and scholastic terms. Some may say that young people usually take others, especially with whom they have close intimacy, as role models. Therefore, if peers can set a good example for their counterparts, they will probably achieve improvement in both academic and social aspects. For example, watching someone of the same age completing the Road to Mount Olympia successfully promoted the desire to be more goal-oriented and fulfill one's own dream of such intellectual accomplishment.",
                "Nevertheless, I believe that the disadvantages of peer pressure are more significant because of mental issues arising from this tendency. It is worth mentioning that the stress originating from comparison among children would make them feel inferior to others, which leads to the fear of expressing themselves as well as potential self-distancing from family and friends. This can be an alarming issue as the worst consequence that may follow is suicide. The dramatic increase in youth suicide in Japan can be a good illustration of this as it is recorded that in 2019, 70% of suicide was among men aged 20 - 44.",

The reason for this is that many students nowadays already have a burdensome volume of schoolwork and a hectic curriculum to follow, they would find it challenging to have spare time if one more subject is added to their already tight schedule. For example, when a primary state school in Japan introduced a new scheme of forcing students to learn foreign languages, it raised a number of objections from parents as they voiced their concern over the paramount amount of stress their children have to suffer from.",
                "Nevertheless, I would argue that teaching foreign languages to primary school students is more beneficial in terms of developing their intellectual faculties and improving their future employability. It is true that the acquisition of a new language at the beginning level promotes frequent exposure to diverse and unique cultures. Such experience allows children to gain an enormous wealth of knowledge about others' customs and lifestyles as well as develop an acute awareness of other exotic people. Furthermore, foreign languages are undoubtedly a crucial tool to open more job opportunities. Employers in certain sectors have a tendency to recruit applicants who demonstrate exceptional linguistic competence, which suggests that students possessing expert language skills are more inclined to have chances to work in various fields such as interpretation, diplomacy, aviation, etc.",

Due to the ability to schedule one\u2019s meal at one\u2019s own discretion, this trend appeals to people with its convenience. Eating with other family members requires people to synchronize their plans to match at a certain time of the day for meals, which proves to be a difficult task as everyone has their own timetables. For example, for families with adults employed in jobs that have different working hours, one from nine-to-five and the other being night shifts, there would be virtually no time where both would meet and dine together. Therefore, it would be more convenient and practical for both parties to eat separately.",
                "On the other hand, the trend of people not dining together with their families affects both the individual and the society adversely. First, a shared meal is the perfect opportunity for family members to mingle and tighten their bonds. As a result, if family meals are obliterated, familial bonds will be decimated. For individuals, these bonds are the base of a healthy mindset as people who grow up without storge often suffer from more emotional problems than those who are surrounded by their kins. For society, these family ties are the fundamental units that build up communities. These are the reasons why once family meals are obliterated, leading to weakened bonds between members, the individual and their society will be affected gravely.",

                "That in recent years, open-space offices are replacing working areas with separate rooms has become a hot topic of debate. In my opinion, the positives of this trend overshadow the negatives.",
                "On the one hand, open spaces have two drawbacks, which are an increased level of distraction and risks to employee\u2019s health. First, working in a communal space easily drives one to distraction. From noises of phone calls to colleagues conversing, an employee faces loads of disturbances that can cost them their work efficiency. What is more, a communal office space is an ideal environment for diseases to spread. Take the \u201c3 green\u201d model that was employed by various factories during the height of Covid-19 in Vietnam for example, due to the employees living in close proximity, Covid-19 spreaded easily and the model had to be deployed soon.",
                "Despite the disadvantages, I believe the advantages of open-plan offices are more considerable. First, an open-space office can facilitate communication and foster friendships between employees. An open space allows employees to communicate with one another more freely and timely. This leads to ideas flowing more effortlessly and innovations to be born more quickly. Furthermore, by working together and having more chances to get to know each other, employees can form stronger bonds, thus boosting the company\u2019s culture. Moreover, open-space offices help save cost on amenities such as printers, scanners, and lockers. Whereas separate offices require a multitude of these equipment, employees who work in an open-plan office can share these utilities.",
                "In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of open-plan offices eclipse its drawbacks. Due to its ability to help the company cut costs and facilitate interaction and innovation, open-space offices are the future of working space."

                "On the one hand, being able to take phone calls at any time is extremely beneficial. Mobile phones allow people to handle urgent situations anytime and anywhere, and this benefits not only the individuals but large corporations as well. In terms of businesses, mobile phones help them to be available to customers round the clock via hotlines. As a result, customer service will be improved and with that comes increased profits. Regarding individuals, mobile phones allow quick and easy communication with their families and friends, despite the geographical location. Moreover, even on holidays, emergencies at work can be dealt with swiftly using mobile phones. This is especially advantageous in lines of business that require frequent and prompt problem solving such as show business.",
                "On the other hand, there are undeniable issues with the ability to use mobile phones at all times. First, mobile phones are great distractions which can interfere with lives outside of work. If a person is regularly disturbed by work messages or phone calls, they can never truly enjoy their time off with their friends and family. Moreover, having to answer to problems at work any time will throw a person off their work-life balance as they are always ready to engage in work. In the long term, stress and declined mental health are to be expected.",
                "In conclusion, the advantages of being able to communicate via mobile phones anytime do not eclipse its disadvantages and vice versa. Instead, what people should do is to use their time and phones wisely in order to achieve a work-life balance."

                "To start with, using the internet as a storage for knowledge has two great benefits. First, the internet provides people with quick and easy access to a great variety of information. Whereas in former times, people had to spend much time leafing through numerous pages in search of knowledge, modern people can look for different types of information with just a mouse click. Moreover, with the internet and the help of electronic devices, knowledge is accessible anytime and anywhere. To illustrate, even while running, people can still absorb information from podcasts or audio books, which would be impossible with traditional books. Moreover, the internet allows people to keep more diversified types of knowledge. Since the internet is capable of storing audios and videos, nowadays, film and musical legacies can be stored and shared with our future descendants with ease.",
                "Beneficial as it is, storing knowledge online also causes two main problems. Firstly, internet users must be aware of fake news. As anyone can post anything online without verification and repercussions, loads of unreliable information awaits uninformed netizens and supplies them with inaccurate knowledge. This can be dangerous in case the information is health-related or law-related. Secondly, intellectual copyrights are at risk due to the boom of the internet. In recent years, due to how loose cyber laws are, the internet has become a tool for millions of websites to distribute pirated publications in exchange for advertising revenues. These copyright infringements inflict substantial losses on the publishing industry and discourage aspiring authors.",
                "To sum up, although storing knowledge on the internet has many disadvantages, it also proves to be immensely advantageous in numerous cases."

                "There are some reasons why I think this generally is a positive trend. Firstly, switching from newspapers to an online medium means doing the environment a favor. For example, if a person consumes even one newspaper per day, in total, it is still hundreds of pages of print a week. Reading newspapers would mean cutting down multiple trees and producing ink frequently just for one person's consumption. Secondly, receiving news through websites or online channels gives you more control as to what content you want to view. For example, if you only rely on one TV program for your daily dose of information, you will miss out on the news not covered for that channel, such as international or entertainment news.",
                "However, despite these benefits, there are still some considerations to be made when switching to an online news outlet. The first thing is that reading news online can be very distracting due to readers having complete control of the content that he or she reads. For example, many people go online just for a casual read but then find themselves deeply engaged in a discussion thread, thus wasting their time. Secondly, news on the Internet is unedited, which means that the sources of this type of information can be unverifiable. Many have fallen victim to fake news posted on the Internet.",
                "In conclusion, saving the environment and being in control of your content are the two main benefits of the development. However, proper censorship and advertisement control should be in use for the Internet news outlet."

Personally, I agree with the latter sentiment more.",
                "Firstly, there are many unscrupulous schemes set forth by travel businesses seeking to exploit local cultures for their own benefit, ultimately preventing the natural evolution of local cultures by freezing the traditions of the past, or at worst, creating a fantasy to enchant the tourists and fulfill their desire for exoticism. Either way, the evolution of these cultural traditions becomes something that is no longer in the hands of the locals but stolen from them. Citizens of cities such as Phuket or Sapa, for instance, often complained that tourism has made the area unrecognizable when compared to its beginnings.",
                "Secondly, the rise of mass tourism can actually cause the disillusionment of many tourists who visit countries for an authentic experience of the local culture, as they may come only to find the recreations of local cultures too artificial after decades of intervention by businessmen seeking to monetize ancient traditions. The end result is that tourists may eventually stop coming, and any income produced may start to dry. This has been the case for countries such as Vietnam, whereby the rate of return for visitors is only around 10%, many of whom cite a disappointing experience as a factor.",

                "There are various reasons why this trend is advantageous to the whole society. Firstly, by following news globally, we can learn about social issues happening in other countries and apply the solutions to our own. For example, many Vietnamese, especially teenagers and young adults, were interested in the recent US presidential election. Many people have reported that they became more engaged in political issues in general. As a result, this year\u2019s election in Vietnam saw a peak in engagement among young adults, with many discussions in online forums. Secondly, more people are watching the same media, like Youtube, which can be an opportunity for us to promote our own culture. For example, more international food bloggers and reviewers are going to Vietnam because they saw videos and TV series broadcasted about Vietnamese food on these global media outlets. As a result, the number of tourists to Vietnam has significantly increased.",
                "However, I must admit that there are some disadvantages to this trend. Firstly, limiting one\u2019s media consumption to outlets that feature news from around the world can mean being ignorant about local news. For example, a small piece of local information, like a recent robbery, can get lost amongst various news coming from around the world. As a result, many can become insensitive to changes in the local community. Secondly, one might lose one\u2019s cultural identities if following global media outlets carelessly. With the rising trend of the Korean entertainment industries, many people in Vietnam are adapting to the Korean lifestyle, for example. This overall is still a harmless trend, but in extreme cases, it has led to young adults degrading their own cultural identities and chasing after foreign cultures.",
                "In conclusion, I understand that there are some disadvantages to this globalization trend in media consumption. However, I think that the advantages brought by this development far outweigh the disadvantages."

For example, in the past, to open up a stock account, people would have to go to a stock company and complete lots of paperwork. By providing personal information online, people save time doing these registrations. Another benefit is that this makes signing in to these accounts easier for users. Instead of choosing security questions and remembering the answer for them like in the past, nowadays, users only need to provide their phone number or email address to get verified. This feature is useful when someone is trying to sign in to a bank account during an emergency.",
                "On the other hand, there are multiple problems with readily providing one\u2019s personal information online. The first one is that, by doing so, the user will become a target for not just material but also identity thefts. Social media accounts are prone to be hacked. Once the thief acquires the person\u2019s address, they can easily break into that person's house, especially with other information already posted on social media, like vacation plans. Even worse, they can impersonate the user to claim insurance. On a less serious note, when users give out their information to the social media company or the bank, there is still a slight chance that these companies will sell it to telesales people. There have been reports that some social media platforms, such as Tiktok, collect and sell user's personal information.",

First of all, it is undeniable that the use of social media allows people to connect to their beloved at ease regardless of geographical location. For example, the application Facebook or Twitter has enabled students studying abroad to contact their family members easily on a daily basis. Furthermore, the proliferation of these online platforms provides people with ample opportunities to make friends with other individuals across the globe. Having international peers is becoming more common as these social sites equip their users with features to find and form friendships with others from other countries.",
                "However, I deem the downsides of the substitution of in-person interaction with online tools more disadvantageous. To begin with, it goes without saying that the use of social media would potentially reduce the quality of interpersonal relationships. People have a tendency to use text or show no desire in face-to-face interactions; also, the addiction to screens has been an alarming issue that needs to be addressed. This phenomenon is detrimental as gradually people\u2019s capability of being flexible and creative in using verbal means of communication would significantly be reduced. Besides, the use of social media poses the threat of losing personal information. Obviously, it is compulsory for individuals to register by providing personal data to become users of these platforms, this source of information could be used for evil purposes such as blackmailing or kidnapping.",

Firstly, the mere experience of working for reputable companies is already making one\u2019s resume stand out to future employers. People often think that an individual must have been extremely talented to be chosen among others to work for that large company, so they are more likely to be interested in that applicant. Another reason is that larger businesses often have a more diverse community. Employees can come from multiple backgrounds, countries, and upbringings. New employees can find it easier to develop cordial relationships with their colleagues. Networking is also easier in larger companies as people who work here are often influential and well-respected in the industry.",

The first one is that these companies are known for their bureaucratic systems. As a result, new employees or interns are rarely given creative space to work on their projects. In worse cases, people can find themselves unable to develop in environments like this because they are seldom assigned tasks that are contributive or vital to the projects. Another disadvantage is that working for large corporations is tiring due to low job security. These companies frequently purge their staff, which creates more pressure on employees to outperform others. Having to compete with so many other workers can take a toll on one\u2019s mental health.",
                "In conclusion, large companies\u2019 reputations will help employees in their future endeavors, while their diverse community helps employees befriend their colleagues. On the other hand, the bureaucratic system preventing individuality and the constant competitiveness are why people should not work for large corporations."

Moreover, plastic does not break easily in contrast to glass containers, making them easier to carry around. Another reason is that plastic containers and cutleries are dirt cheap to produce. Because the materials needed to synthesize plastics are readily available, most plastic containers are at a lower price than their alternatives, especially in bulk.",
                "On the other hand, however, using plastics to store food can pose both a health and an environmental risk. Firstly, most plastic containers end up in the ocean, which will damage marine life. Fish can swallow these plastic cutleries, cannot digest them, and thus die. Plastic is also detrimental to landfills as they decompose relatively slowly, leading to landfill overloads. Secondly, consuming food and drinks using plastic can be harmful. Plastics are known to melt and release toxic compounds when heated, so they should not be used to store hot foods. Another concern is that some plastics contain carcinogens. This means that consumers are at a higher risk of developing cancer.",

                "There are those who believe that an international language would help to foster cross national interactions and remove barriers to economic development. By developing a common system of communication, people from different countries can better explain the culture and history of where they came from. Furthermore, by having a common language, immigration would also be easier, since there would be less difficulty in trying to integrate into a new culture. As a result, economic output might increase, as immigrants bring new talent to areas that require them. Overall, this argument suggests that a global language will mean a more unified humanity.",
                "On the other hand, I argue that an international language is impractical since languages develop organically in interaction with a country\u2019s culture and history. Thus, some words that are exclusive to certain languages would not make sense when translated into a universal system. As such, if an international language were to form, it would likely be the case that it would sooner or later fragment into dialects specific to specific regions of the world, and in the end evolve into new languages anyway. Lastly, since language is a cultural artefact, attempts at replacing all the languages in the world with one common one results in people\u2019s past stories being erased. Instead of unification, I believe that a global language would lead to less cultural diversity.",

Since fast food is both cheap and quick to make, this will appeal to those with not a lot of money and time. Furthermore, fast food restaurants are also a major employer of low skilled workers, and as such, can help to provide poorer individuals with jobs. For instance, fast food chains are one of the biggest employers in countries such as America, especially in isolated towns and counties.",

Firstly, fast food has been shown to cause numerous health problems, such as increased blood pressure and risk of heart disease, which will be very costly to society.

At the moment, being bilingual boosts employment opportunities drastically for prospective employees since they can bridge the gap between two different cultures and economies. For instance, English and Chinese are the languages of choice today, and fluency is a skill sought after by international employers as they hope to do business in both English and Chinese speaking countries.",
                "However, it could be posited that language is the foundation of culture, and if people cannot communicate, they cannot form a collective identity: the result would be that the culture gets eroded over time. Going into more detail, some words in many languages cannot be translated to others precisely because they are specific to a cultural context; the decline of a language would also mean the decline of a culture. Using a more specific example, the Welsh language is barely spoken because the English sought to replace their culture following an invasion; thus, learning Welsh has been considered an important way to preserve culture for many young Welsh people.",

As a result of climate change, biodiversity is at an all time low as changing climates and rising oceans, slowly erodes the delicate tapestry of food webs across the globe.

This admission fee can cover most basic operating costs, such as staff wages, electricity for complex lighting systems, and security. Museums can also utilize this financial support for renovation. For example, Vietnamese museums can benefit from this renovation since most of them are old. Another advantage is that museums can use this money to enhance their performance. They can hire more curators to bring in more interesting collections, create more kids-friendly galleries, or even apply new technologies, like virtual reality or artificial intelligence. For example, many famous museums, like MoMA, provide audio tours for visitors. Science museums around the world also offer a virtual reality tour into the past.\u00a0",

As a result, setting admission tickets too high will defeat the purpose of a museum: to provide a source of education and entertainment to the public.

Self-discipline is the most difficult trait to develop for almost anyone, and telling children that success awaits them if they work hard incentivizes them to become self-disciplined. As a result, they stand a better chance of being successful since they are more goal-oriented and determined. Another reason is that these children will exhibit appreciation for hard-working people.

For example, a child might be so engrossed in one's studies that one neglects to make friends, which might serve as crucial connections many years later.\u00a0 The second disadvantage is that children will show self-deprecating behaviors if this philosophy fails them.

Importing food on the other hand, helps to ensure a more varied supply of fresh local food that was grown in the environment that best suited it. An example we can observe today is the array of food products that can be seen in countries that are involved into the world trade network, for they are able to import foods from overseas.",

Personally, I think that this complex new development is on the whole more negative than positive, as although it can afford young people some independence, it can also create feelings of loneliness for many parts of the population.",
                "From one point of view, one could argue that living alone has also granted young people the ability to do more of what they desire. Without having to spend time taking care of their families, many young people today can instead focus on what makes them tick, socially and professionally. This in turn leads to them going into different fields from their parents, allowing them to craft their own creative projects. In developing nations such as Vietnam, for instance, many young people have been able to engage in their own start-ups, positively improving their career and the national economy.\u00a0",
                "Conversely, the advent of smaller family units has helped to drive up a sense of isolation and a disconnect with one\u2019s own roots. Living alone diminishes one's primary source of social interaction, which comes from the family, possibly resulting in psychological symptoms of loneliness or even depression. This is why despite being one of the most financially independent generations, millennials today report feelings of low mood more than any other previous generations. The prioritization of work and personal ambition, hence, could come at a cost of a diminutive social life.",
                "In conclusion, I argue that while young people can be more independent living alone, this arrangement also brings with it the comparatively worse effects of a worse mental health. Therefore, the trend described in the question is one I argue is unwanted."

Hostility between people of different backgrounds has been lower as a result of globalization, and this is almost certainly due to more intermingling as a result of national job markets shifting to be more international. Countries such as Korea, for instance, which has been isolationist for most of history, is today one of the world\u2019s biggest economies, attracting foreign workers from all over the world. As more workers change their working locations as a result of globalization, one might envision a more culturally understanding world.",
                "Yet on the other hand, the flip side of this phenomenon is the increasing difficulty of maintaining long-term relationships for most workers. Changing one\u2019s job or place of living frequently means being unable to have a strong bond with a friend group for an extended period of time. This makes it very difficult to connect with people and could lead to an overwhelming feeling of isolation spreading amongst the workforce as they are forced to prioritize their work over their friends. Relocation is difficult and could lead to severe culture shock as well, which could increase anxiety and stress. This is why the majority of employees, for example, often state job security as one of the primary motivations for them to accept any jobs.",

First of all, this offers staff increased flexibility and full control of their timetable, which is likely to diminish the unnecessary high stress levels and thus boost their work productivity. For instance, working mothers find this incredibly helpful for them to multitask between rearing their children and joining meetings to keep abreast of developments in the company. Furthermore, this online mode of operation could help companies economize on expenditure by not having to pay for electricity bills, printed documents or equipment for carrying out the meeting or training procedures, for instance.",
                "On the other hand, this option has two major drawbacks. Firstly, communication via the internet can be a hindrance as there might be failures in the flow of information. For example, in Vietnam, not many people can afford high-speed internet connection, and as a consequence, lagging connection or computer crashing can cause disruptions, reducing the comprehension among meeting or training participants. In addition, there is little room for practice and the lack of direct guidance also prevents people from fully grasping the skills. It would be less productive because employees receiving training cannot apply what they are taught on the internet, or can be clumsy in their actual performance since there is no one to show them whether they are doing it the right way as reality is sometimes completely different from theory.",

Students from abroad find themselves exposed to different cultures, while local students can learn how to introduce and promote theirs sincerely. Another benefit is that abroad students can build their independence through this program. Many abroad students live alone or stay in schools\u2019 dorms with other local students. Sometimes, this will be the first time they buy groceries, cook, or do laundry without the help of family. These experiences will shape their independence over time.",

At a high school level, a year of international exchange means a potential disruption in one\u2019s studies. For example, a Vietnamese curriculum differs much from an American one, which means Vietnamese students would miss out on subjects like literature when studying abroad. Moreover, a study abroad program might cause a reverse culture shock on students when they return. This phenomenon describes a person finding it difficult to adjust to one\u2019s own culture after a time in other countries. In extreme cases, usually occur when students study abroad in a developed country and return to a developing one, they can exhibit hatred for their own culture.",

For example, when older applicants cannot find jobs, they cannot support themselves and their families. As a result, society would witness multiple financial crises. Also, this will affect future generations as their parents most likely could not afford to pay for tuition. Another consequence would be that rejecting applicants based on age would mean discrimination based on a personal element. This violation of human rights would serve as a precedent for much more unfair treatment in the workplace, such as discrimination based on gender, race, or sexual orientation.",
                "Secondly, I believe rejecting applicants based entirely on their age will eliminate many potential ones. Many industries, especially science, have tips and tricks that are not taught at schools. For example, many labs still hire old applicants because they have experience operating and fixing equipment that many fresh graduates would not be familiar with. Another reason is that older employees usually have more connections. These connections, more often than not, can help them complete tasks quicker than younger employees. For example, in the banking industry, to meet the KPI, bankers need to reach a minimum amount of money lent to businesses or individuals. Because older employees are more likely to have connections with successful business owners, they can accomplish this task better.",

By helping out people who they are familiar with growing up, they will feel more thankful and personally connected with their neighborhood. Secondly, through unpaid volunteer work, young people can significantly alleviate social problems and improve the quality of life in their community.

The first drawback is that this year of voluntary work will be an interruption in their studies or their work. Many students can easily forget knowledge learned after just a few months of not continuing their studies, let alone a year. The second drawback is that if this policy is mandatory, it can pose a stressor to the younger generation. For example, many already have multiple responsibilities to tend to, like taking care of their siblings, working for their families, or struggling to study or find a job.

For example, cardholders conveniently do not have to carry around lots of cash, which means that they are at a lower risk of being robbed. Another reason why credit cards are safer than cash is that they have PINs, which discourage thefts. The second benefit is that, because each bank now has its credit card, they offer various unique features to appeal to their customers. For example, most credit cards have a cashback or reward program. This cashback can save cardholders lots of money when grocery shopping, while the reward points can sometimes be converted to free trips or hotel bookings.\u00a0",
                "However, there are still some drawbacks to having credit cards, which is why many people still choose to pay by cash. The tendency to overspend is one major problem with credit cardholders. Because credit cards allow users to spend more than the amount in their account balance, many users indulge in their spending, thus incur debts when they cannot pay back by the end of the month. Another problem is that credit cards are often targets for scams. Many people carelessly share information that might be answers to their security questions, like their relatives\u2019 names, or the model of their first car, which makes scammers\u2019 jobs easier. Another mistake when using credit cards is to take pictures of your credit card number, along with the PIN, since it is easy to hack into your phone to retrieve this information.\u00a0",

Another advantage is that by utilizing robots, humankind can achieve more remarkable feats in science and technology.\u00a0 Because robots complete repetitive tasks quicker and more accurately, incorporating robots into the workforce will result in higher productivity. As a result, clothing, pre-packaged food, or technological devices will be available to humans at a cheaper cost.",
                "Nevertheless, the massive use of robots will guarantee serious consequences. The most obvious one is a global loss of jobs, as robots are taking away positions occupied by humans. For example, with the automation of production lines, many factory workers will find themselves without a job and any qualifications or skills to apply for another. As a result, governments will face a wave of unemployment, potentially leading to financial crises. Another consequence is that the dependency on robots will cause a lack of survival skills.

Working arduously and continuously to climb to a higher position on the career ladder has been the ultimate goal of employees due to their obsession with acknowledgment from society. Concerning the second reason, a myriad of domestic duties such as taking care of children and parents has led to the insufficient amount of time allocated for individuals themselves. The shortage of time for relaxation and recharging energy has contributed to the impossibility of balancing work and life for most people.",
                "Fortunately, the efficient working approach and the sharing of household responsibilities can be applied to address those problems. With regard to the former, people should modify their working style, from laboriously to efficiently and productively by means of multitasking. For example, waiting time in commuting by public transport can be used to check emails, plan personal schedules or revise reports. Turning to the second idea, family members are encouraged to share household chores with each other to lighten the burden that one has to carry. In this way, everyone would have more time to cater to their favorite pastimes such as watching a movie or journaling after working hours.",
                "In conclusion, people cannot achieve the goal of balancing working and living due to the pressure of maintaining a stable financial state as well as projecting a positive image to meet the requirements of society. However, the modification in working styles and the division of household work could be plausible to solve the problem."

                "The increasing rates of suicide and homelessness could be the main problems of social rapid development. It is true that higher rates of suicide have gone hand in hand with the rise of cities. This is because of the extreme amount of stress originating in harsh competition in working environments that exists within cities. Another common issue with cities is homelessness. The more people move to the cities, the more unaffordable prices of houses in the central area become. This leads to a high concentration of homeless within cities such as London or New York. Also, as automation increases within cities, it is likely that there will be a higher rate of unemployment. Hence, the problem of homelessness will likely persist.",
                "Possible solutions to solving these problems may include the provision of access to more mental health services and the relocation of industrial zones to the suburbs. Chief among these is that more funds should be allocated to the healthcare system or passing legislation that would make it mandatory for companies and schools to provide assistance to those with psychological problems. Regarding the latter solutions, urgent actions should be taken to move major industries to the outskirts, which consequently prevents people from migrating to cities and hence lower the homelessness rate in metropolises.",
                "In conclusion, there have been many problems that have been associated with the rise of cities, such as higher suicide rates and homelessness. Nonetheless, there are steps that can be taken to help remedy these issues."

                "There are many reasons for this development, two of which are the purposes of showing off people's wealth and enhancing their social standing. The first factor behind it refers to the desperate need to boast about one's opulence, from which some individuals\u2019 pleasure is deprived. The practice can be explained by the pride people may take when others express great admiration towards their exclusive possessions which are allocated for organizing luxurious weddings. Another point worth mentioning is that these days, the social standing of a family tends to depend on the way they organize their children\u2019s weddings. If the celebration is grand and splendid, their position on a social scale would be greatly promoted. Consequently, there would be an increasing number of families attempting to set up weddings that are as magnificent as possible.",
                "In my opinion, expensive weddings are negative for several reasons related to unnecessary competition in extravagant spending, and wastage of resources. Chief among these is that many families would enter into rivalry with one another to show their affluence, which forces them to spend immoderate amounts of money on such sumptuous celebrations. The worst consequence to be considered is that those people could live in an era of indebtedness. The second issue worth exploring is that tremendous resources such as food and clothes would be wasted. For example, after weddings are organized in a restaurant, it is usually reported that a great number of leftovers would be thrown away as it is impossible for them to serve the purpose of reusing.",
                "In conclusion, I understand the tendency of setting up bigger and more costly weddings partly as a means of showing one\u2019s wealth and partly as an approach to upgrade their social status. However, these reasons cannot satisfy the negative effects involved.\u00a0"

The first factor behind it refers to the widespread availability of jobs in myriad fields in different places, which encourages migration to ensure the livelihood and the growth of career prospects. Thus, individuals have no hesitation in making relocations at frequent occurrences. The second, and also the possible explanation is that improvement in transportation, including the wide range of vehicles such as airplanes, subways, and electric buses, has beneficially facilitated traveling at ease. It is true that people would find no difficulty in moving from one place to another with affordable prices and in a short amount of time.",
                "In my opinion, this development is positive for several reasons related to chances to accumulate profound knowledge and the eradication of prejudice among different ethnic groups. Chief among these is the regular change in one\u2019s residential address plays a crucial role in maximizing exposure to other cultures and customs. Consequently, there is a high possibility that this practice would enhance one's mentality and broaden his or her horizon as well.

                "First of all, the trend of delayed parenthood could be attributed to two main reasons. To start with, people are attaching more weight to their professional lives rather than their personal ones. A considerable number of young adults nowadays spend the first years of their adulthood to lay a concrete foundation for their career and only start building a family once they have achieved certain professional milestones. Furthermore, many people are of the opinion that children are better raised in families with sound financial statuses. Such a family can mostly be found among older couples, who have spent years working and accumulating their wealth.",
                "As to the impacts of delayed parenthood on society, I strongly believe that neither its advantages or disadvantages can outweigh the other. On the one hand, having older parents can bring many benefits for a child. Since the couple will probably have had a stable financial background, the child will likely to have proper education with less worries about loans and debts. Another advantage is that aged parents are more knowledgeable, meaning that the child can be reprimanded appropriately from their upbringings, which is a positive sign for an upright citizen. On the other hand, older mothers are more prone to grave health risks during pregnancy and their children are more exposed to innate diseases. It has been proven that women having kids after the age of thirty can be dangerous for both themselves and the babies, which is why this decision is not recommended by health staff.",
                "By and large, people choose to bear children at older ages due to their high regards for their careers and the belief that a better financial state will be better for a child. Nevertheless, how this trend can impact society is both positive and negative."

Compared to other sectors, agriculture around the world does not have a high income and oftentimes, this earning is unstable as it depends heavily on the yield of the crops. Another possible cause for this trend is universal education, which leads to more young people thinking that being farmers is not high-class enough for an educated person. They tend to gravitate towards jobs that are perceived as smart and classy, such as white-collar professions, since lives on the farm are usually painted as modest and dull.",
                "Despite the aforementioned reasons, young adults should be incentivized to become farmers. First, farming has been and will always be one of the most important sectors of society, that is why a shortage in personnel could lead to worldwide crisis. Food being one of the fundamentals of life means that its supply process should be well-oiled in order to sustain people\u2019s well-being.

                "As consuming healthy foods and exercising are beneficial to individuals\u2019 well-being, a plethora of methods can be employed to incentivize people\u2019s commitment to this trend. First, making physical activities mandatory in a school and an office setting can help convert sedentary people into more active individuals. No matter how long the exercise is, as long as it gets individuals up and working out, over time, they will form the habit of doing physical activities. Moreover, the government should offer free exercising facilities, such as communal gyms to all citizens to encourage less fortunate people to participate. Last but not least, decreasing tax on healthy foods can support people\u2019s intake of these kinds of foodstuff, instead of veering to unhealthy choices, such as fast food.",

                "To start with, the increase in consumer goods production stems from two key reasons. First, it is accelerated by the spread of consumerism. Businesses are fond of this trend as it can help them generate a fortune. However, what the buying culture actually causes is people\u2019s intensifying demands for new innovations and depreciation of their existing assets. Consequently, products which are still usable are discarded rather than recycled, increasing the amount of trash. Moreover, people\u2019s lack of awareness on the impacts of contemporary products to nature is another major cause. Some clueless consumers are over-optimistic, thinking that the clothing item they just dumped will be reused, without thinking about the underlying costs such as energy and harmful fuels coming from the recycling process or the production of their new garments.",
                "Nevertheless, effective measures can be taken to minimize consumer goods\u2019 adverse effects on the environment. First, businesses should opt for environmentally-friendly materials. This is both fashionable for the company as educated buyers nowadays prefer eco-friendly products made from natural materials like bamboo, and help the business to reduce their carbon footprint. Furthermore, an extra tax could be levied on companies which use fossil fuels, and a monetary incentive could be provided for businesses to switch to renewable energy sources. For example, Lego has announced that their first carbon neutral plant will be constructed in Vietnam. Aside from other appeals, the Vietnamese government has strong support for renewable energy development, with generous economic incentives like tax exemptions.",

Nowadays, food is not a rarity but rather something that exists in abundance in many countries, especially in developed ones. The proliferation of consumerism has led to a surplus of foodstuffs, which means that people do not see it as a survival necessity but as a form of entertainment. Old money and new money alike buy food without thinking about its use and their food consumption rate, and as a result, products that are not eaten must be discarded.",
                "To address this problem, definite actions need to be taken. To start with, governments should raise consumer\u2019s awareness on conscious consumption of food items. Citizens should be taught how not to overbuy and overconsume, and instead reuse leftovers or portion their meals accordingly. This could be aided by the use of educational television programs or community campaigns hosted by local authorities and institutions. Secondly, implementing a fine for households which discard food more than the average dumping rate. What the government can do is to introduce a reasonable quota of food waste that each individual can discharge and levy a tax on those who exceed their quota.

                "There has been an increase in the unemployment rate among the young in various countries, which has stirred up great concerns. This essay will discuss the problems as well as possible solutions for this issue.",
                "As a matter of fact, the rise in youth unemployment is going to negatively affect a country in many aspects. First, the short-term and long-term effect on the national economy is inevitable. The fact that the most potent generation cannot contribute would be an immediate loss. Meanwhile, an aging workforce is going to be an imminent problem with insufficient supply of young power. From an individual perspective, one who fails to find a job may suffer from stress stemming from family and peer pressure. In extreme cases, this can even lead to depression and deaths. Examples have been set in Japan, where a small proportion of jobless young adults, called hikikomori, refuse communication with the outside world and have to rely on their families or social assistance.",
                "In order to address the issue, various strategies can be adopted. Firstly, to increase the rate of employment, one has to be trained or educated properly. Many countries, especially in Africa, need to raise their citizen\u2019s awareness of the importance of education so as to decrease the school dropout rate. Secondly, governments should subsidize vocational training programs for youngsters to enhance their skill sets. Moreover, from an individual point of view, parental support is crucial in guiding the young generation on correct career paths. It has been proven that students who receive mental guidance and support from their parents stand a higher chance in success later in life.",
                "In conclusion, high youth unemployment is going to have detrimental effects on the economy and social situation of a country. In the fight against unemployment amongst youngsters, both governmental and parental support are urgently needed to ensure the future of the young."

                "As a matter of course, not being able to read or write will limit one\u2019s accessibility to general knowledge. Nowadays, written sources of information still account for the majority of knowledge. Take signposts, for example, the best option on the road for a driver to rely on to locate his whereabouts are road signs. However, with these being written signs, people who are unable to read have to find counterintuitive alternatives to look for directions. Moreover, illiteracy can put one at a great disadvantage at work where written messages play a crucial role in day-to-day communication. What most white-collar positions require these days is the ability to perform basic office tasks such as typing. This means that illiterate people would not be qualified for any of these jobs, and consequently, are tied to blue-collar, low-paid posts.",
                "Nevertheless, there are a number of solutions that can be applied to alleviate this issue. First, ensuring universal education will play a significant role in the fight against illiteracy. Basic classes that teach reading and writing should be openly accessible for citizens of all ages, especially the disadvantaged or ethnic minority groups. Furthermore, infrastructure concerning education such as schools and roads needs to be constructed and improved in a way that people in all places can gain access to educational institutions easily. In Vietnam, many ethnic children have lost their right to learn due to poor road conditions; therefore, infrastructure should be one of the first areas that need fixing.",

Yet changes can be made to enable the illiterate to stand an equal chance in life through universal education and education-related infrastructure."

                "To begin with, the rapid population growth in major cities has led to two serious problems for youngsters. First, the young populace has to face a housing crisis. The speed at which people migrate is faster than the speed at which cities can build infrastructure. Therefore, once the number of dwellers rise exponentially, housing is bound to run out, causing many to resort to areas with lower living standards. Take Hong Kong for example, due to a lack of land, house prices in Hong Kong can reach almost 2,000 US dollars per square foot. This has driven many people to move into flats which can fit only a bed. Another issue is that the cost of living in these cosmopolitan cities tend to be more costly as compared to rural areas. For example, in America, the living cost in Atlanta is only a half of that in New York.",
                "Problematic as it is, I believe that there are two possible solutions to the above mentioned issues. First of all, the government should relocate businesses to the city outskirts and other provinces. By doing this, more land area can be liberated for housing purposes. Moreover, as job opportunities are spread evenly throughout the country, a city would not have to face a surge of migrants. Secondly, a price stabilization policy should be implemented for basic necessities. This is to ensure that private businesses have to operate according to the fixed price bracket of the law, thus guaranteeing that city dwellers will always have access to food, water and electricity, and gasoline at a reasonable price.",
                "To sum up, the trend of migration to major cities has two setbacks for young people, which are the lack of housing and high living cost. Nevertheless, relocation of businesses and price stabilization for basic necessities can help tackle these problems."

From an individual perspective, the longer people live, the weaker they become. The degradation in health results in a plethora of diseases that older people have to painfully withstand. Not to mention that the inability to continue working for the elderly makes them feel left out or redundant. As a consequence, there are high chances that they are prone to negative feelings, thereby adversely affecting their mental health. On a societal level, stagnation on a national scale is an ultimate issue caused by having too many old people. A great proportion of governmental fund and social welfare would be allocated to health care which most elderly requires. Thus, there would be an imbalance in investment in other sectors, namely education or transportation, which play a pivotal role in developing the country.",
                "Fortunately, the government and businesses can and have carried multiple solutions to lessen the effects of this issue. The first measure is gradually lifting the retirement age. The government is implementing this solution by increasing the retirement age by a few months every year. This would ensure that people can still be a contributor to society when they reach their old age. A second solution is to offer fitness facilities that would encourage the elderly to do regular physical exercises. As a result, they would find their own happiness in their later years of life. In addition, once old people have good health, the demand for health care and social welfare would significantly reduce.\u00a0\u00a0",

Trees are cut down to clear space for cow grazing, farming, and wood harvesting. This leads to a direct loss of natural habitat for wildlife and exposes flora and fauna to the risk of extinction. According to recent estimates of the World Animal Foundation, around 137 species of flora and fauna are lost to deforestation per day. Another reason worth mentioning is climate change. Due to the greenhouse effect, the world\u2019s temperature has been rising non-stop, which culminates in the increasing frequency of wildfires that are life threatening to both plants and animals. For instance, in 2020, Brazil\u2019s wildfires wiped out an estimated number of 17 million animals.",
                "While this phenomenon is catastrophic, there are a number of feasible solutions to tackle this problem. First, governments should implement stricter policies regarding commercial logging. Heavier fines should be levied on illegal loggers and forest ranger forces should have more reinforcements. Such tough measures will discourage illegal timber harvesting operations to a degree. Another solution is to encourage large companies to cut down on their carbon footprint. Corporations the world over can switch to eco-friendly energy sources and materials. For example, LEGO is currently building a carbon neutral plant in Binh Duong Province in Vietnam in an effort to minimize its carbon emissions.",

In this essay, I will outline why I believe the lack of interest from local populations arises from the fact that they are already part of the culture and thus do not feel the need to discover it. In order to remedy this, I argue that museums should constantly change their exhibitions to uphold variety and pull in more domestic visitors.",
                "I believe that it is almost counter-intuitive that the local populace, who have been affected the most by cultural and historical sites in their town, have the least interest. It may merely be the case that the reason why foreign tourists are the main visitors is because they come to experience local sites and cultures for the first time, and as such are more attracted to these places of cultural and historical significance due to their novelty. This is why many Parisians do not visit the Eiffel Tower, for example, because they already see it every day, and spending money to explore it is simply a waste.",
                "Thus, I argue that in order to attract the local populace, most museums should use a system of special exhibits that are replaced after a few months. This instills a sense of urgency as the exhibit is only available for a limited time, which may foster the interest of the local populace. The Modern Art Museum in London regularly hosts various exhibitions, for instance, attracting millions of visitors from London every year. This way, locals might find it more worthwhile to explore local museums, since there is something new to see every time.",
                "Overall, I argue that the reason why many local people do not visit their museums or historical sites is due to a lack of novelty, and as such, this can be fixed by a more dynamic exhibition."

Many office workers are asked or expected to not leave the workplace until they meet their deliverables, which means they are working overtime almost every day.

It is a fact that the gym industry is growing and so is the popularity of having a personal trainer.

For example, the K-pop wave is unbeatable in Vietnam, with almost all teenagers having listened to this genre at least once. Classical music is not as widely appreciated, often called \"music for people with taste\u201d. This discourages young people from learning more about classical music as it distances itself from the general public. Another reason is that people cannot relate themselves to classical music due to it having no lyrics and there is little interaction between the artists and the audience. As a result, the artist distances himself or herself from the audience, which is why people find it hard to be fans of classical music, but they readily become K-pop fans.",

Also, classical music has been proven to aid in learning things. However, I do not think that teenagers should be encouraged to listen to classical music.

                "Nowadays, with the prevalence of restaurants and food shops, many people are concerned that food waste from these businesses is becoming a problem. Although there are legitimate reasons for the problem, there are also solutions to it.",
                "The most common reason why restaurants throw away food at the end of the day is overestimating the number of their customers. Restaurants are not entirely to blame for this since customer flow varies from day to day and depends on multiple factors, such as traffic or weather. For example, on rainy days, restaurants can expect a significant reduction in the number of customers. Another cause of food waste in food businesses is to avoid lawsuits for food poisoning. If a restaurant reuses its ingredients for the next day\u2019s food, it runs a risk of food poisoning, which usually ends up either in a bad review or a lawsuit against the business. For example, many franchise bakeries have their employees throwing away any baked goods that did not make the sale at the end of the day.",
                "However, fortunately, there are some solutions to prevent or lessen the effects of this problem. The first solution, already used by multiple restaurants, is to donate the extra food. Homeless shelters, orphanages, or even the employees themselves would greatly appreciate the food. Many restaurants in rural areas even feed the waste veggies to their farmed animals, like cows and pigs. However, to prevent food waste from happening in the first place, restaurants need to avoid over-preparing food. Large-scale restaurants can afford to survey how their customer flow fluctuates with different factors to predict how many portions they should make each day. Businesses can also design better menus to minimize potential food waste. For example, menus that have multiple dishes that share common ingredients can reduce material waste.",
                "In conclusion, although there are legitimate reasons why restaurants and shops find it hard to prevent food waste, there are still solutions that can prevent or lessen the effects of food waste."

                "In the last decade, there has been a significant rise in the number of plagiarism cases reported. I believe that both a lack of interest and poor time management skills can explain this phenomenon, but there are also solutions to tackle this.",
                "Among various reasons for this dishonesty in writing-intensive courses, one that stands out is the lack of interest in the course. Many students are forced to take the class to fulfill some requirements for graduation, which is why they think they can spend time doing something else. As a result, they often plagiarise because they did not learn anything in class. However, many students with good academic performance also plagiarise simply because their time management skills are inefficient. For example, many overachieving students aim for multiple goals at once, meaning they do not have enough time to tend to each one. This lack of time explains why they tend to plagiarise to save time writing essays.",
                "Regardless of the reasons, plagiarism can be tackled through various methods. Firstly, professors can check in with students more often during the writing process. This method is most often used in college education to ensure that students do not have problems in their writing process. This method lowers the chance of plagiarism since students will have to discuss their papers with teachers beforehand. Secondly, many schools also offer peer-review sessions before submitting papers. These sessions are for fellow students to read each other\u2019s works and check whether they might run a risk of plagiarising. Many professors even give out bonus points for those who detect signs of dishonesty.",
                "In conclusion, I believe that the increasing rate of plagiarism in education mainly stems from a lack of interest in the course, along with poor time management skills. However, by adopting check-ins with students mid-writing and peer-review sessions, teachers can tackle this problem."

I think the element of suspense plays a significant role in this success, and generally, it has positive effects.",
                "There are many reasons why people enjoy this genre of entertainment. Many people find the element of suspense presented in these TV shows interesting. Crime TV shows are usually of the thriller genre, which means the audience can pick up various clues and hints from the characters, plots, or settings. As the crime unfolds, the show stimulates and challenges the audience to think critically. As a result, most people will experience a rush of adrenaline watching these shows. Another reason is that police work and criminal investigation are normally obscured from the public eyes due to the nature of the field. As a result, when TV shows portray these lines of work, the audience always wants to know more.",
                "Regardless of why people are into crime TV shows, these genres generally do have positive aspects to them. The first effect is that it trains people\u2019s observational and critical thinking skills. For example, by watching how detectives investigate crimes, people can learn how to set up a hypothesis and logically prove the theory. Another positive effect of watching crime TV shows is that it portrays a more positive picture of police and law enforcement. Many crime TV shows, like CSI, have inspired people to become forensics technicians. This effect is crucial because this is a field of work that, while interesting and honorable, is tremendously understaffed and underappreciated.",

In my opinion, this has been a result of the production process in making these drinks becoming ever more efficient, and in order to stop them from being increasingly sold, the government should apply a sugar-tax meant to dissuade producers from putting sugar in their drinks.",
                "Firstly, I believe that mass production techniques have lowered the costs of producing soft drinks which are then sold abroad. As more products are made using machinery, the marginal cost of creating them goes down. This results in a glut of products that cannot be absorbed by a domestic market alone, and is thus shipped worldwide in order to increase profits. This is why companies such as Coca Cola and Pepsi can be seen all over the world today.",
                "Nonetheless, I argue that government intervention in the form of a supply-side sugar tax might be the solution. Instead of having customers bear the cost of a higher tax, producers should be charged if they use sugar in their products. This in turn forces these companies to create products that are healthier. In the UK, for example, a sugar tax has been shown to be effective at reducing the sugar consumption across the country.",
                "In conclusion, I argue that mass production mechanisms have allowed soft drinks companies to expand their markets and allow more people to use their products.

                "Because most disposable products derive from plastic, they pose a considerable threat. Firstly, the production of these products will eventually lead to a depletion of natural resources. The majority of plastics are now made from natural gas or compounds related to the oil industry, which are both materials that are becoming more scarce.\u00a0 Secondly, the mass disposal of single-used products leads to an accumulation of waste and a pollution problem. Because plastic products are non-biodegradable, when disposed to the oceans, marine animals, like fish, can swallow them and die. Plastics can also cause soil and underground water contamination through leaking microbeads to these environments.",
                "Luckily, these harmful effects can be prevented by efforts made by both governments and businesses. Firstly, enterprises that consume lots of single-use products, like restaurants or supermarkets, can promote behaviors that reduce this usage. For example, some supermarkets in Ho Chi Minh City are now charging extra when customers do not bring their shopping bags. Some coffee shops and restaurants can also give out reward points when customers use their own bottles or utensils. Secondly, governments can take steps to entirely ban the use of single-use products. For example, they can start by taxing heavily on these items. Other effective actions include placing a fine when people excessively use these types of products.",

Because they have less time to spare, they would choose to dedicate this free time to building connections, taking care of themselves and their families, or learning another skill. As a result, they spend less time with their neighbors. Another reason is that people are becoming more reserved. People value their privacy more than they do in the last decade, which is why they tend to keep to themselves more. For example, many young adults living in apartment buildings admit to not conversing with neighbors for fear of being scrutinized or talked about.",

For example, a neighborhood can hold decorating or cooking events and traditional games to celebrate Tet or Christmas. Another solution is to create group chats on social media platforms to communicate. So far, this solution has proven to be successful for most apartment communities.

Personally I think this is the result of stagnating wages and the advances of automation, and can only be resolved with a universal basic income for the whole population.",
                "Firstly, I argue that society is witnessing the worst wage stagnation in generations, which is causing people to constantly look for better paying jobs. As cost increases yet wages not following suit, most of the workforce have to scramble to reach for managerial positions or risk losing their disposable incomes. This in turn creates a situation where many people have to take up multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. In the US and UK, for instance, it is estimated that millions of workers are on zero-hour contracts, which does not guarantee a set number of hours of work.",
                "Secondly, as corporations seek to reduce expenditure as much as possible, they aim to replace the workforce with machines, leading to higher levels of unemployment and less stable job conditions. As machines encroach on the workforce, jobs become focused on the maintenance of the robots running our factories, and therefore there is higher competition for the dwindling number of jobs with gradually raising entry barriers. The end result is sure to be tension amongst socio-economic classes that can afford entry into the workforce if the effect of automation is not being mitigated.",
                "I argue that in order to solve this, it is important to implement Universal Basic Income, which is an equal lump sum of money given to all citizens of countries every month or year. This would help people to keep their jobs and not have to take up precarious work, since they have enough money to buy basic necessities. This scheme can already be seen in Canada during the COVID 19 outbreak, for example, with citizens getting 2000 Canadian dollars a year. This has been hugely popular, as it allowed Canadians to have some level of stability even as the economy came to a halt.",

As a population grows, more natural resources are needed towards housing and infrastructure projects; this leads to environmental degradation as forests are chopped down and fossil fuel burnt in order to cater to the needs of extra people. The country of Vietnam, for example, has experienced a population boom in recent years, which could be said to have contributed significantly to its major cities of Hanoi and Saigon being ranked two of the most polluted in the world.",

For example, many older people enjoy chatting with their friends while taking an afternoon stroll.",
                "In conclusion, the lack of incentive, combined with a fear of injuries, is why older people suffer from a lack of physical fitness. However, creating exercising habits and developing a welcoming community for older people to exercise are ways to counter this problem."

Hence, I argue people should elect politicians who can implement progressive taxation to mitigate the consequences.",
                "As prices increase, the upper class continues to be able to provide for themselves since they have more income to spend, while the middle class is impacted by this to a much more significant degree, leading to the deteriorating mental health of the latter group. As basic amenities and rent begin to cost a bigger portion of middle-class incomes, more families would begin to slip into the working class category. In turn, this results in deteriorating mental health conditions for those on the wrong side of the wealth gap. Subsequently, class tensions will arise between the haves and have-nots, as we see in developed economies such as the United States and Britain, which often result in political fallout and instability.",
                "Therefore, I argue that countries with high costs of living should elect politicians who can distribute the income of the rich to help those at the lower echelons of society. This in turn creates a more equal society, where the rich and the poor have equal access to resources that can help them live a fulfilling life. Rich countries such as Norway and Sweden have done this effectively, resulting in their population reporting to be among the happiest in the world. This way, the costs of living might still be allowed to rise, however, the majority of the population will be able to share the burden more equally.",
                "Overall, I argue that higher living costs often affect the poor much more than the rich, and government policy should be aimed at redistributing the wealth from top to bottom so that the whole population can continue to benefit from economic development."

For example, many people think to themselves that climate change does not happen till they are already dead so that they can continue their habits.

                "There are two main reasons for the ignition and acceleration of this throwaway lifestyle. For one thing, we are living in a consumer society in which newly released products bombard the market on a daily basis. This, in its turn, allows people to make regular purchases in order to keep up with the cutting- edge technology. Another major point to consider is the deliberate production of short-lived goods. The massive manufacturing industry of every country is expanding, resulting in increasing demand of people\u2019 consumption. This leads to the fact that consumer durables are being replaced gradually by other less durable goods. As a result, users are left with no chance but to throw away the broken products and opt for new ones.",
                "This can cause problems, the most obvious being the detrimental effects on the environment. Goods require not only raw materials such as wood, plastic and metals, but also energy in the form of oil and electricity, for example. Therefore, we are consuming these resources in far greater quantities since there are more people with the money to buy them, they are buying them at shorter intervals and the goods generally require more resources to manufacture. An example of this is the use of rare earth metals in the production of electronic goods. Another issue that economists have noted is that a throw-away society encourages people to spend rather than to save money. It is certainly economically advantageous to have people spending as this creates jobs. However, if people do not save enough to provide security in their old age or when they are ill, this becomes a problem.",

This leads to the creation of underdeveloped slum areas, where underprivileged individuals must live in poor living conditions like lacking medical care or even drinking water. Another issue is the traffic jam due to the burgeoning car ownership. Arguably, cars take up more space than a motorbike while its capacity to accommodate passengers is far inferior to that of a bus. This weakness results in bumper-to-bumper traffic, particularly in downtown areas where many drivers have to inch along to get away from the terrible traffic.",
                "Governments should take steps to move a certain number of city dwellers to less populated areas. The main reason is that shifting people to towns or even the countryside helps to decrease the unemployment rate. This is because as more and more people apply for the same position within a company, it may intensify the competition among employees, making it significantly more difficult to be chosen. Towns, however, due to industrialization, are now able to provide different jobs for engineers or officers in new factories. Therefore, by encouraging job seekers to move to these newly developed areas, the government can lower the number of unemployed individuals in cities.",

We all require a certain amount of money to afford necessities like food and housing, not to mention additional services such as healthcare and education. Because of this, most people put a high value on financial security and devote mental energy to contemplating financial matters. Consequently, it is logical why many individuals need to verbalize their emotions and worries around finances. In addition, discussing financial matters is considered normal and natural discourse in several regions and cultures. It is a wonderful conversation starter, and if the individual has a prestigious job, it may even earn admiration from others.",
                "Nevertheless, I feel that discussing such sensitive information is inappropriate. Being excessively preoccupied with wealth might lead to an obsession with material possessions. The reason is that superficial appearances are given more weight in social evaluations than essential character qualities. Secondly, this practice may foster discrimination. Teenagers who are financially unable to purchase expensive clothing already sometimes face humiliation and mockery from their peers. There is already evidence of this trend in nations where wealth is revered, such as China, where young people shame one another and parents shun offspring based on their economic prospects.",

Furthermore, the job market is exceedingly competitive, and there is a severe lack of positions in this industry. Even if a significant amount of energy and time is devoted to science education in school, there is still a low likelihood of employment following graduation. This is because society places a higher value on money than on research, and hence only finance majors are hired.",

Scientists work on various initiatives with the overarching goal of making the world a better place for future generations.

First, informal communication through texting or post-it notes is faster and simpler to understand, and anybody may utilize it in any circumstance. Formality also impairs communication flexibility. For instance, everyday language enables employees to access several channels simultaneously, such as text messages, Facebook messages, and Tweets, rather than being confined to email alone. Moreover, the formal structure of employee engagement may be intimidating, which is where an informal approach can be beneficial. If an employee is not reaching required standards or punctuality, a lighthearted text message containing emojis may typically resolve the issue.

Concerning the former reason, it is true that ancestral lineage research enables the reconnection of family members. This could potentially be of great comfort to orphans or those who do not know who their parents are. DNA tests, for example, have helped many people without family to track down their long-lost relatives and discover brothers and sisters they never knew they had. Turning to the second point, knowing the medical history of a family enhances the understanding of genetically inheritable medical conditions such as asthma, obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, people would take appropriate action to identify ways to mitigate the adverse effects of diseases.",
                "From my perspective, the overwhelming desire of finding family history can be deemed positive due to its role in preserving familial culture and customs and motivating individuals to overcome life\u2019s troubles. Chief among these is that the discovery of ancestry plays a crucial role in maintaining the culture and traditions of one\u2019s family. Once the descendants are fully aware of the significance of cultural values passed down from previous generations, they would show more willingness in preserving as well as promoting those intangible merits. Moreover, a means of self-motivation can be regarded as one of the worth-mentioning advantages of examining family roots.

Therefore, both parties, namely individuals and governments, should ensure accountability to solve the problem.",
                "The two main factors behind this degradation are contaminated air and clearing forests. Concerning the former, the excessive growth of industrial production combined with the substantial increase in the number of transportation leads to the disposal of harmful gases to the environment. These substances are generally considered as the key factor destroying the ozone layer which protects the Earth from detrimental effects of ultraviolet rays. The second point is that overpopulation and lucrative timber harvesting have negatively driven people to deforest. As a result, some adversely worth-concerning consequences are animals\u2019 struggling to survive and the frequent occurrence of natural disasters, which creates an imbalance in the whole ecosystem.",
                "Both authorities and individuals are accountable for the issue of environmental damage. Obviously, governments have to pioneer in saving the environment as those competent authorities can make collaborative efforts in enacting new international laws which ensure citizens\u2019 compliance with all regulations in protecting our surroundings. In addition, each person is responsible for not doing harm to the environment as his or her daily performance would directly impact the habitat. For example, provided that individuals awareness of reducing plastic use on a daily basis, the total amount of this substance disposed to the environment would significantly plummet.",

Furthermore, as the product creates its own segment in the market, the company can have full control over the price and distribution, which will not be viable if the product is a duplicate.

                "To start with, people\u2019s declining amount of time spent with their family stems from the generation gap and the boom of personal entertainment choices. First of all, the generation gap has been a longstanding problem. Due to a disparity in beliefs between ages, a lack of understanding is born, making one generation in a family feel less sympathetic towards another generation\u2019s problems. Thus, cross-generational communication becomes less enjoyable for all parties. Secondly, more personal entertainment choices are readily available now, reducing people\u2019s need to partake in other activities. While in former times, people could only talk to one another or take part in outdoor activities, nowadays, people are engrossed in unlimited forms of entertainment, and neglecting to spend time with their families.",
                "The tendency of sparing less time with their family brings both the individual and the family undesirable impacts. Firstly, individuals who are not close with their family tend to be more problematic. Children growing up without parental love are more susceptible to emotional problems such as being emotionally detached or having low self-esteem from feeling undesired. As a family is everyone\u2019s basic need, what living apart does is taking away one of life\u2019s necessities. Moreover, with weak ties, families can be broken apart. This is because the basic function of a family is to support each other, without quality time together, this goal cannot be achieved.",

I believe there are two main reasons for this, and I don\u2019t think this is either an entirely positive or negative phenomenon.",
                "The first reason why attending tertiary education nowadays is more competitive than ever is due to the vast investment of parents into their children\u2019s education. In the past, it was acceptable for a child to drop out of school to help with farming. However, most parents now want to ensure a better future for their kids, so they urge them to compete for a slot in the most prestigious university possible. The second reason why universities are getting harder to get into is simply because of the rising population of high schoolers. More universities should have been built to accommodate this demand from upcoming generations. However, because the rate of opening new colleges cannot compete with that of population rise, children would have to compete against one another for college admissions.",
                "Regardless of the reason for this development, I do not see this as entirely positive nor negative. On the one hand, there are some benefits to this. Future generations will be more knowledgeable than the current ones. With an influx of fresh graduates equipped with high-level knowledge, the country can expect more technological developments. This can be seen from the growth of entrepreneurship in the technology industry. On the other hand, however, this intense competition will take a toll on both students and parents. More time will be spent studying for the exam, which equates to deteriorating physical and mental health of high schoolers. Parents are also affected by the mental and financial pressure of finding and paying for tutoring centers.",
                "In conclusion, getting into colleges is more competitive due to children being more competitive and the population rising. Although I think this is a positive development for society, some measures are needed to prevent the ultimate burnout."

Many office workers suffer from health problems such as back and neck pains, migraines, and sleep deprivation. Overworking seems to be the common cause of these problems. By restricting working hours, employees have more time to rest, thus improving their health. Another reason why I think countries introduce this law is to protect employees from being abused by employers. For example, it is common nowadays that marketing agency employees are expected to not leave until meeting their deadlines, which means they work overtime without getting paid.",
                "Regardless of the reason, I think that this is something to be encouraged. Firstly, limiting working hours will help improve employees\u2019 moods as they do not have to overwork anymore. As a result, the relationship between corporate and employees improves, leading to a warmer cooperation attitude. Secondly, although it may come as a surprise, there have been studies showing that productivity is boosted by limiting working hours. These studies point out that working shorter shifts will help employees stay more focused as it does not take as much a toll on workers\u2019 physical and mental health, hence improving productivity for the whole workplace. This is especially true for factory workers, as repetitive motions can cause drowsiness, so limiting working hours keeps their minds sharper.",

Traveling by car means you can add multiple stops anytime and don't have to adhere to bus schedules. For example, you can stop to buy street snacks or suddenly decide to drop by a friend\u2019s house. Cars are also convenient for other reasons. Having a car means you can carry around more stuff, which is helpful for grocery trips or a weekend picnic.

Also, family members can pick up others instead of having two cars. Another solution is to encourage ride-sharing apps or programs.

In my opinion, the environment is a much larger factor in individuals\u2019 propensity to commit crimes, and therefore, such endeavours will not stop children from breaking the law in the future.",
                "Firstly, it could be argued that there are indeed biological factors that can predispose individuals to certain behaviours, including antisocial ones. Theories of natural selection suggest that the gene for aggressiveness can be passed down through generations, as it was more likely to help previous humans survive. Therefore, if we are able to discern which mechanisms in the brain can trigger such emotional responses in children, we might be able to identify which children are at risk of becoming criminals. For instance, brain scans studies have shown that criminals who have committed crimes but pleaded insanity have a less developed amygdala than normal people.",
                "On the other hand, it could be said that seeing crime as an individual issue takes away the collective responsibility of taking care of children so that they do not have to resort to crime. Studies show that there is a direct correlation between poverty and crime rates - thus, it is safe to infer that individuals are much a product of their circumstance as much as their genetics. If children are raised in an area with ample economic opportunities, I argue that it is likely they will commit less crimes in the future. Therefore, efforts to predict children\u2019s behavioural patterns should instead be redirected to providing for their needs.",
                "Overall, I believe that while a neuropsychological approach to crime can be attractive, it is far too simplistic and takes into account an inadequate role of nurture. Thus, I believe that using children\u2019s behaviour to prevent crime is unnecessary and ineffective."

                "Television channels today regularly devote more air time to men\u2019s sporting events over women\u2019s. Personally, I believe that the reasons for this are financial, and whilst efforts should be made to give equal time to men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports, viewership means that this would be a difficult task.",
                "Firstly, the main consideration of television channels and studio executives to prioritise men's sports is viewership, as more views mean more advertising revenue . Television channels need to make a decision on how best to utilize the amount of time they have in order to secure the highest ratings, and the reality is that men\u2019s sports tend to be more popular than women\u2019s sports. The men\u2019s World Cup Finals, for example, had viewership in the billions, whilst this number was much lower for the womens\u2019 World Cup. Since TV channels\u2019 main purpose is to make money, it is not difficult to see why they would prefer to showcase men\u2019s sports over women\u2019s.",
                "However, there is the consideration that giving women sports more publicity can help to alter public perception over time. If something gets a huge amount of newspaper, radio, and television coverage for decades, it is unsurprising that it would eventually become popular. Therefore, what may help make the world of sports coverage less divided would be to report more on women\u2019s sports and to increase its air time. The overwhelming popularity of women\u2019s football in the United States, for example, provides a stunning testament to the ability of the media to be able to thrust women\u2019s sports into the limelight. Applying this method to other sports might mean they can become popular as well.",
                "In conclusion, I argue that the reason why men\u2019s sports have been given more coverage than women\u2019s is due to ratings playing a fundamental role in how media companies operate. Nonetheless, by shifting the attention to female sports, the media can make them as successful as men\u2019s sports in the long run."

                "Nowadays, it is reported that parents are not spending enough time with their children. There are multiple reasons for this, and out of the two parties, the issue tends to affect children more than parents.",
                "The first reason why parents neglect their children is their hectic schedules. Many parents currently work more than one job, and they also have to socialize and network with friends and colleagues. Some even have to take care of their elderly parents. Children are also busy studying, hanging out with friends, or dating. Another reason could be that both parties have differences in viewpoints. Parents can be condescending towards their children, resulting in banning them from doing things they are interested in, such as getting tattoos, dyeing hair, or wearing revealing clothes. On the other hand, children also lack the patience to communicate with their parents respectfully. As a result, children and parents actively avoid spending time with one another.",
                "Although this negligence affects both parents and children, children are still getting the more negative end. Children naturally look up to and copy their parents. As a result, when parents do not spend enough time with their children, children can lack communication and other soft skills, become more distrustful, or treat their future children in the same way. Moreover, children, especially teens, are more emotionally sensitive than parents. This negligence can be detrimental to their mental state. For example, this lack of care can easily imprint in their minds that their parents do not love them, they are worthy of being isolated, and that they cannot find solace in the home. Many suicide cases have resulted from parents not spending time with their children.",
                "In conclusion, it is understandable why parents do not spend enough time with their children. However, parents need to work on this more because this negligence affects children more negatively and seriously than it does parents."

                "Firstly, I believe that social media has allowed people to catch a glimpse of foreign locales, which in turn entices them to visit destinations that they otherwise would not have before. When people see travel adverts through online platforms, they are compelled to explore it themselves and showcase their experience on social media. This is why many people on the internet today have been able to create a career out of travelling and posting pictures on the internet alone: there is a huge market for the advertisements of travel destinations on apps such as Instagram and Facebook today.",
                "However, increased travel to tourist destinations has inadvertently internationalized them over time as governments and urban planners aim to make the stay of rich foreign tourists more comfortable and luxurious. Gradually, little by little of what makes the place special is replaced by a generic, commercialized shell. This creates a situation in places such as Angkor Wat in Cambodia, where the serenity of the temples is destroyed by the overwhelming number of tourists.",
                "Overall, I believe that the rise of the internet and social media in particular has contributed to the proliferation of global travel. Nevertheless, tourism has thrived at the expense of the destinations' local cultures. On the whole, I therefore argue that this development has been an unwanted one for most local populations."

                "It is understandable why many stay away from studying science. The first reason is that students do not have bright career prospects in science. Scientists, lab technicians, or engineers are underpaid compared to their efforts to get to those positions. Moreover, some companies are heavily bureaucratic, especially when it comes to research positions, which further discourage students from studying science. Another reason is the way universities teach science subjects. Most classes focus solely on too much math and complex problems that do not have many applications. This, combined with little interactivity in classrooms, outdated information and lab equipment is why enrollment in science majors is dropping.",
                "The government and society should take this problem more seriously because it has adverse effects. Fewer science majors mean fewer R&D activities. For example, most factories in Vietnam such as Samsung and Unilever, only focus on assembly and production according to foreign procedures and recipes. In the long run, foreign technological companies will treat Vietnam as a source of cheap employment for their production lines. Another reason why this would be a problem is that the general public will have distorted views about science. The US society is currently suffering from this problem directly. Too few people pursuing studies in science leads to an ignorant and distrustful society. This kind of society readily falls victim to conspiracy theories, like the flat-earth or the anti-vaccine movements.",
                "In conclusion, it is reasonable why many students choose not to study science at a higher-education level. However, the government should take this development more seriously because it causes insurmountable issues for society."

I argue that utopias are also an obstacle to human progress, for it removes the need for suffering, which is fundamental for finding meaning.",
                "Firstly, it is impossible to actually describe a utopian society that works for everyone, since every person has a different idea of what utopia constitutes. When two conflicting views of the ideal society come into conflict, the use of force might have to be used in order to implement one version of reality over the other. For example, whilst one person might envision an ideal society as one where they can do business as they please, many others might view a utopia as one where private property and businesses are abolished, and where people do not have to work. It is simply impossible to reconcile the two, and attempts at implementing utopia might fall apart upon disagreement.",
                "Secondly, it could be argued that there is an innate metaphysical value to suffering that utopias would eradicate. Suffering could be said to be essential to us, for it is what provides meaning to our lives - to live in utopia, where there is no suffering, could be to abandon all meaning.\u00a0 For example, even though child-rearing can often be very difficult, many parents still endure hardship for their children because they view it as a meaningful endeavor. In a utopia, where everyone could get everything they want, it might be said that there may be no motivation to embark on meaningful pursuits.",

                "One of the most important reasons why people do not want to rent houses or apartments is because they are dependent on landlords or potential roommates. Owning a home means you are in total control of how your house looks like, how many people it hosts, or even how many utilities it uses. Landlords can also throw people out at any moment during their rent or, in many cases, can break into tenants\u2019 space at their convenience. Moreover, owning a home also means an elevated social status. You are now considered a functional, successful, responsible adult. For most men, you are also considered a better candidate for marriage because you are now ready to welcome a new family into your home.",
                "I think, generally, this is a positive development for individuals. Switching from a rented property to an owned home benefits individuals financially. Because tenants depend on landlords to control the rent, they usually waste more money renting a place for a long time than owning one. Owned houses are also an investment as many houses can gain value over the time that owners stay there. For example, houses in Go Vap District now triple in value compared to what they used to be a decade ago. Another reason why people want to be a homeowner is due to the positive correlation between owning a home and better mental health. Owning a home usually means a sign that adults have made it in their lives, which in turn eases the mind of adults. For some, home-owning even means increased privacy.",

Most of them have more resources to invest, such as money to send kids to cram schools or to find the best tutor. There are many learning resources available as well, like art schools or soft skills workshops. Parents overwhelmed by these resources will try to send their kids to each one possible. Another reason is the competitive state of current society. Reunions for adults now are just opportunities for parents to brag about their kids, which strengthens the belief that parents need to expect more from their kids. How society perceives parents depends on their children\u2019s achievements.",
                "Regardless of the reasons for this development, it is indeed detrimental for both parents and children. The obsession with success is mentally exhausting for both parties when they constantly worry about how others are doing and how to improve. Many teens and young adults fall into depression, anxiety, and extreme stress due to this. The rates of adolescent mental health problems and suicide are both higher than ever before, which is proof of this burnout.

Technological improvements decrease the dependency upon human labor, which is often more expensive in the long run than machines for producing products such as airplanes.
